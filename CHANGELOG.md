# Changelog — Sensei React App

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.59.1] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed — the prep report never blocks on the live backend

- `#/report/<patientId>` no longer shows an error wall when the senseiapi
  next-meeting report can't be generated (e.g. the backend's Ollama model is
  missing or unavailable). It now falls back to the demo prep body with a subtle
  notice, so the page stays usable regardless of the model's state. A live report
  still renders when it succeeds, and "רענון דוח" can retry.

## [1.59.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed — assistant recommended questions aligned to what it can actually answer

The "שאל את סנסיי" panel's suggestion chips now map to reliable backend workflows
(agenda, meeting cadence, last-session summary) instead of asking for data the
backend can't serve:

- Chips are now **"מה יש לי ביומן היום?"**, **"מתי נפגשתי לאחרונה עם סימבה?"**, and
  **"סכמו את הפגישה האחרונה עם סימבה"** — each answerable end-to-end via the
  assistant's patient → meeting → summary tool chain, using a patient present in both
  the offline demo data and the API-connected backend seed. Demo/offline canned
  answers are unchanged.

## [1.58.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added — live AI chat assistant (streaming) with tool calls + expandable UI

The "שאל את סנסיי" panel now streams real answers from the senseiapi
`/assistant/chat` endpoint (OpenAI-backed), and can fetch grounding data via tools.

- **Live streaming via `@ai-sdk/react`.** When `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set, the
  assistant uses `useChat` with a `DefaultChatTransport` pointed at `/assistant/chat`,
  rendering the reply token-by-token from the backend's Vercel AI-SDK "UI message
  stream" (SSE); Bearer token attached when auth is on.
- **Expandable tool-call chips.** When the assistant calls a backend tool
  (`discover_api`, `http_get`), the panel shows a collapsed 1-line row that expands to
  the full request/response (JSON, `dir="ltr"`).
- **Clickable patient deep links.** `#/patient/<id>` in a reply renders as a friendly
  "כרטיס המטופל/ת" link (raw id in href only) that opens the patient card.
- **Demo mode unchanged.** With no backend configured, the panel keeps its original
  canned answers; the mode is chosen once at mount.
- **New dependencies:** `ai` and `@ai-sdk/react` (first runtime deps beyond React).

## [1.57.5] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Patient file: the hero now shows a visible one-line "מהפגישה הקודמת" recap
  (same source and trim as the home focus card) — answering "מה השתנה מאז
  הפגישה האחרונה" at a glance, without opening the session history. Hidden for
  archived patients; the TTS button still speaks the full text.
- Link metadata: the canonical URL and Open-Graph/Twitter tags now point at the
  actual production host (sensei-hackathon-app.vercel.app) instead of a stale
  Netlify deployment of an old build — link previews and crawlers now reference
  the maintained version.

### Tests
- `tests/patientHeroRecap.test.tsx` locks the visible, trimmed hero recap.
## [1.57.4] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Week grid: when 3+ events overlap, each lane sliver now shows the patient name
  only (the truncated category/time fragments were unreadable at that width);
  the full details move to a hover tooltip and remain in the screen-reader label.
  Two-lane and lone events keep their full two/three-line content.

### Tests
- Extended `tests/calendarOverlapLanes.test.tsx` with the dense-lane contract
  (single name span + tooltip carrying time and category).
## [1.57.3] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Week grid: events that overlap in time now share the day column side-by-side
  (greedy lane assignment, fractional widths) instead of stacking on top of each
  other and hiding one another — found in a visual audit of the production build.
  A lone event still spans the full column; each event stays identifiable via its
  aria-label, and drag/click behavior is unchanged.

### Tests
- `tests/calendarOverlapLanes.test.tsx` locks the lane layout (distinct offsets
  for overlapping events; full-width for a lone event).
## [1.57.2] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Dashboard home focused as a control center (progressive disclosure, smallest
  safe changes; no functionality removed):
  - The onboarding tip now auto-hides once a first upload succeeded — after
    that it is no longer guidance, just noise (dismiss still works as before).
  - Side panel reordered actions-first: today's agenda → mini month →
    Google-Calendar (roadmap stub) → category legend. Previously the roadmap
    stub sat above the actionable agenda.
  - The "סוגי פגישות" legend is now a native <details> collapsed by default —
    every calendar event already prints its own category label, so the legend is
    a secondary decoding aid. Keyboard-accessible with zero JS.

### Tests
- `tests/dashboardFocusHierarchy.test.tsx` locks all three behaviors (tip
  auto-hide + fresh-account visibility, side-panel order, collapsed legend).

### Audit
- Dedup sweep: jscpd 1.59% (gate <5%); no duplicate implementations found; the
  dashboard reuses the existing DashboardSummary/DashboardFocus/session-category
  SSOTs unchanged.
## [1.57.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Version reconciliation: two parallel working sessions shipped the same change
  (side-menu upload removal + CI coverage-threshold ratchet) as 1.56.1 and
  1.57.0. This release consolidates them — the union of both edits (nav entry
  and sidebar CTA removed, mobile tab dropped, guards updated to the new
  contract, thresholds 80/80/76/80) — under one forward-moving version.

## [1.57.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Upload was removed from the navigation menus by request (sidebar destination,
  its side-menu CTA, and the mobile tab) — the flow stays fully reachable from
  the home welcome card, the next-session card, the agenda quick actions, the
  patient file, and the #/upload deep link. Nav/mobile-tab/uxTier1/shellChrome
  tests updated to the new contract, including a guard that upload is NOT a nav
  destination and that a working home entry point remains.
## [1.56.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- CI coverage thresholds ratcheted from 75% to just under measured coverage
  (statements/branches/lines 80%, functions 76%; measured 81.5/82.0/77.7/81.5) —
  a coverage regression now fails CI while ~1.5% headroom remains for normal
  refactoring. No production code changed.
## [1.56.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added
- הגדרות · פרופיל: שדה "לשון פנייה" (לשון נקבה / לשון זכר) — the editable single
  source of truth the Hebrew grammar layer (window.HG) resolves every gendered
  string against. State-driven, so all personalized copy updates live, with no
  reload; ready to be populated by the backend profile when the API is connected.

### Changed
- Eliminated every remaining slash-based gender form (מטופל/ת, מאשר/ת …) — 24
  occurrences: the clinical letter now genders through HG tokens keyed on the
  patient (neutral fallback while patient gender is unknown), and the prep-report
  line, session insight, and signup-terms label use natural gender-free phrasing.
- Removed dead transcript-excerpt data (TRANSCRIPT_EXCERPTS, TranscriptLine,
  sessionTranscriptExcerpt) — zero consumers, and spec §3.4 removes transcripts
  from the product entirely.

### Tests
- `tests/hebrewGenderCoverage.test.tsx`: bans slash-gender forms app-wide,
  verifies the לשון-פנייה select edits the SSOT, and proves personalized copy
  flips בין המטפל/המטפלת per gender without a reload.
## [1.55.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Removed the global top app bar app-wide to maximize usable space. Its actions
  are relocated into the sidebar with no loss of function: the primary "העלאת
  הקלטה" CTA at the top, the demo-mode indicator, and the theme toggle + account
  (settings) + logout in the footer. The only remaining content-column chrome is
  the off-canvas drawer toggle, shown ≤860px where the sidebar becomes a drawer.
  The homepage now begins directly with its content (Daily Overview → Next
  Appointment → today's list → Calendar) under the page heading.
- Standardized every checkbox on one blue design-system component
  (`components/shared/Checkbox`, `.ds-checkbox`): blue border + tint when
  unchecked, `--primary` fill when checked/indeterminate, tokened hover/focus/
  disabled — replacing the browser-default gray. Applied to remember-me, signup
  terms, and the New-Patient "schedule first session" toggle. Both themes, RTL,
  identical across desktop/tablet/mobile.

### Notes
- Dividers/borders already resolve entirely from the light-blue design tokens
  (`--divider` #DBE6F4 / `--line` / `--primary-border`) — an audit found no literal
  gray/black borders bypassing tokens, so no divider changes were needed.

### Tests
- `tests/checkbox.test.tsx` (checkbox SSOT contract + blue styling present) and
  `tests/shellChrome.test.tsx` (no top bar; Upload/theme/account/demo relocated to
  the sidebar). Updated `canonical`/`uxTier1`/`sidebarDrawer` for the moved chrome.
## [1.54.3] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Homepage: the today's-list quick actions (patient file · upload · prep report ·
  play) now reach the 44px touch-target floor at the tablet/touch breakpoint
  (≤1024px, where the desktop shell is used on touch devices). The compact 30px
  height is kept for the mouse-driven desktop; a `min-height` layered inside the
  existing media query bumps only the touch case, with zero desktop change.

### Tests
- `tests/dashboardTouchTargets.test.ts` locks the responsive 44px rule so the
  touch-target floor can't silently regress.
## [1.54.2] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Completed the blue field floor with a shared disabled state: any disabled
  input/textarea/select now drops to the muted `--surface-2` fill with
  `--text-disabled` text, reduced opacity, and a not-allowed cursor — so an inert
  field never reads as an active blue field. Uses the same non-text-type exclusion
  as the floor (a disabled checkbox keeps native rendering) and stays in sync with
  the existing `.app-select:disabled` rule. No fields are disabled today; this
  future-proofs the SSOT so the state is correct the moment one is.

### Tests
- Extended `tests/blueFieldSurface.test.ts` to assert the disabled floor rule
  (muted `--surface-2` fill + `not-allowed`) is present.

## [1.54.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Completed the unified blue field surface across the remaining controls: the
  global shell/AI/help/search inputs, the transcript search, the documents search,
  and the mobile insight textarea now share the same `--primary-surface` fill +
  `--primary-border` edge as the rest of the fields (migrating the last gray
  `--divider` / `--border-input` borders and `--paper` / `--surface` backgrounds).
- Added a zero-specificity `:where(input…, textarea, select)` "blue floor" in
  global.css so every future text-like field inherits the approved blue surface
  automatically, without per-field styling (non-text controls — checkbox, radio,
  file, range, color, buttons — are excluded; the command palette input keeps its
  intentional `background: transparent`). Documented in DESIGN_SYSTEM §5.

### Tests
- `tests/blueFieldSurface.test.ts` locks both invariants: the `:where()` blue
  floor is present, and no `<input>/<textarea>/<select>` sets a gray background
  inline — preventing silent drift back to gray fields.

## [1.54.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Unified every editable/selectable field onto one blue design: inputs,
  textareas, selects, search fields, date/time pickers, and the compact document
  picker now share the `--primary-surface` fill + `--primary-border` edge (via the
  `.app-select` / `.app-search` SSOT classes, a shared field-surface rule for
  `.shell-input` / `.auth-input` / `.set-input`, and matching inline styles) —
  replacing the earlier mix of white (`--paper`), gray (`--surface-2`), and
  browser-default field backgrounds. Value/placeholder text keeps `--text` /
  `--text-muted`; error states still show the red `--error` border. Verified live
  in both themes: fields are visually consistent with strong contrast
  (value ≈13.9–15.7:1, placeholder ≈5.4:1, both above AA). DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
  documents the unified field surface.

## [1.53.3] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Duplicate-patient warning (a key decision moment when adding a patient) was
  referencing CSS variables that don't exist (`--warn-bg`/`--bg-2`,
  `--warn-border`/`--border`, `--text-1`), so it rendered without its warning
  background or border — just plain text a user could miss. Repointed to the real
  `--warning-bg` / `--warning-strong` / `--text` tokens; the warning is now
  visually distinct in both themes (verified live). A new guard
  (`tests/tokenReferences.test.ts`) fails CI on any `var(--token)` reference to an
  undefined token, so this class of bug can't recur. 542 tests.

## [1.53.2] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- New-appointment default time now always lands in working hours (09:00–20:00).
  Previously it rolled to 09:00 only after 20:00, so opening the app in the small
  hours pre-filled an unrealistic session time (e.g. 02:00 at 1:30 AM). Now
  before 08:00 it defaults to 09:00 the same day; after 20:00, 09:00 the next
  day; daytime keeps the next 30-min slot. Verified live (defaults to 09:00 at
  1 AM). New regression test covers all hours.

## [1.53.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Performance: recompressed the three brand PNGs (sensei-mark logo,
  sensei-scroll, sensei-fan) with pngquant at high quality (82-96), cutting
  ~400KB of image weight (603KB → 203KB total, roughly -67% each) with
  dimensions and appearance unchanged (verified live: the sidebar logo and the
  decorative mark render identically, no artifacts). The logo is on the
  critical path (always-visible sidebar), so first-load is lighter. No code,
  behavior, or layout change.

## [1.53.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Reduced `services/calendar.ts` public surface: six helpers used only inside
  the module (`CALENDAR_TIME_ZONE`, `weekLastDay`, `normalizeGoogleEvents`,
  `buildCalFixtureItems`, `patientIdsMatch`, `calendarEventSlotKey`) had an
  unnecessary `export`. Verified no external references anywhere in src or tests,
  then made them module-private. No behavior/bundle change (tree-shaking already
  dropped them); clarifies the module's real API. 533 tests green.

## [1.53.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Schedule form: the session-time field became a native time picker
  (`<input type="time">`), matching the date field (which was already a native
  date picker). Previously it was a manual text field requiring exact "HH:MM"
  typing, with a format error on mistakes — inconsistent with the date field
  and higher-friction, especially on mobile (date got a native picker, time
  needed the keyboard). The value format is unchanged ("HH:MM"), so the
  conflict/availability logic is untouched; on mobile this is now a native wheel
  picker. The time error updated to "יש לבחור שעה לפגישה" (there's no format to
  get wrong now). Verified live: both pickers native, value binds, conflict
  check runs.

## [1.52.5] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Dead-code removal: dropped two never-called exported helpers
  (`activePatients` / `archivedPatients` in `services/patients.ts`) — the app
  uses inline filters + the `S.archivedPatients` store slice, so these were
  defined, exported, and never referenced anywhere in src or tests. Verified via
  a project-wide call-site + import scan; no runtime behavior change. (The wider
  audit found no unused dependencies — only react/react-dom, both used — and the
  gates already enforce no unused imports/locals and <5% duplication.)

## [1.52.4] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Copy: the summary screen's network-error fallback was a bare "שגיאה"
  ("Error") — non-actionable and inconsistent with the app's specific-error
  convention. Replaced with "לא ניתן לטעון את הסיכום. נסו שוב." (couldn't load
  the summary, try again), matching the sibling messages. A full copy audit
  found the rest of the error/validation/empty-state copy already specific,
  actionable, and reassuring.

## [1.52.3] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Home: the workload strip's "today"/"this-week" counts disagreed with the
  greeting subtitle and the calendar (KPI showed 1 today / 5 week from
  `scheduledAppts` only, while the subtitle + calendar showed 3 / 15 from the
  complete event source). The strip (desktop) and the mobile greeting now derive
  their counts from the same `weekEvents` (seed fixtures + scheduled) the
  calendar renders, so the numbers agree everywhere. Verified live: desktop
  subtitle + KPI + mobile greeting all read 3 today / 15 week, matching the
  calendar. Regression test added.

## [1.52.2] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- De-duplication: the seven near-identical destructive-confirmation dialogs
  (archive · permanent-delete · delete-session · delete-transcript ·
  delete-meeting · wipe-data · delete-account) were consolidated into one shared
  `ConfirmDialog` renderer (single source of truth for the confirm-dialog frame);
  per-dialog icon, copy, confirm label + handler, and optional extra content stay
  as props. ~56 lines removed; behavior, copy, icons, and handlers unchanged
  (verified live: archive + delete-account flows; 532 tests incl. the dialog
  suites pass). The audit found the other jscpd clones to be intentionally
  distinct concepts or below the rule-of-three, so they were left as-is.

## [1.52.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Empty-state consistency: the calendar day view's empty state ("אין אירועים
  ביום זה") now offers a "פגישה חדשה" action button, matching the week-empty
  state and every other empty state in the app (all provide a clear next
  action). Reuses the existing schedule-dialog handler — no logic change.

## [1.52.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Design-system consistency: list-search inputs (patient roster · archive ·
  meeting-history directory) unified into one `.app-search` SSOT that matches
  the standardized `.app-select` box (44px, 1.5px `--border-input`, 10px radius,
  14.5px) — they previously mixed 44/46px heights and 1px `--divider` borders,
  breaking the input/select rhythm. Adds a consistent focus border. Verified:
  all three share one computed signature identical to the selects.

### Added
- Perceived performance / a11y: the route-load skeleton (`PageFallback`) now
  carries a polite `role="status"` "טוען…" live region, so screen-reader users
  get spoken feedback during lazy screen loads (the skeleton stays decorative).

## [1.51.1] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Mobile: the bottom-bar clearance padding moved from `.mob-shell` to
  `.mob-content` (the direct content flow), so tall pages whose content
  overflows the flex box — the calendar week grid — now end above the bar
  instead of behind it (verified at true max scroll).
- Mobile touch targets: the roster row edit / archive buttons and the archive
  restore button (visually 34px) gained the `.tap44` hit-expansion (~46px
  effective), meeting the 44px floor without changing their appearance.

## [1.51.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Dropdown quality pass (all form selects, via the shared `.app-select` SSOT):
  replaced the browser-default chevron with a custom one whose size, offset,
  spacing, and colour are identical everywhere — 14px from the inline-end edge
  (physical left, RTL-only app) with 38px of inline-end padding so the value/
  placeholder never touches, overlaps, or is clipped by the arrow. The chevron
  matches `--text-muted` per theme (light/dark). Verified: consistent across the
  9 selects (upload, schedule dialog, roster/report/history filters), both
  themes, and 200% zoom with no clipping. DESIGN_SYSTEM.md documents it.

## [1.50.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added
- Mobile bottom navigation (`MobileTabBar`): a fixed, thumb-reachable tab bar
  surfacing the primary daily-action destinations (בית · העלאה · מטופלים ·
  יומן) so the most-used screens are one tap away in the thumb zone, instead of
  only via the top hamburger. Derived from the navConfig SSOT (the group before
  the first section), active-state + aria-current tracking (incl. patient
  drill-in), 56px targets, safe-area inset, content clears the bar, transient
  toasts lift above it. The header drawer keeps the full nav (records/tracking +
  pinned utilities) — nothing hidden or duplicated.
- Navigation governance rules documented in PRODUCT.md (§3): where new features
  go per group, the ~4–5 primary cap for the bottom bar, contextual-route policy,
  and the SSOT/guard-enforced growth model.

## [1.49.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- Shared `Highlight` renderer (components/shared) over the existing search SSOT
  (utils/search `hlParts`): scoped search result lists — patient roster, patient
  archive, meeting-history directory, and the Help FAQ — now highlight the
  matched substring in `<mark>`, consistent with the global ⌘K palette / search
  page. Single source of truth; RTL-safe; screen-reader friendly.

## [1.48.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Information architecture: the primary sidebar navigation is now grouped for
  orientation — the four daily-action destinations (דף הבית · העלאת פגישה ·
  מטופלים · יומן) stay unlabelled at the top, and the three review-oriented ones
  (דוח לפגישה הבאה · היסטוריית פגישות · ארכיון מטופלים) sit under a new
  "מעקב ותיעוד" section label, above the pinned "כללי" utilities. No routes,
  labels, order, or destinations changed; the ⌘K palette and global search are
  unaffected (they derive keyed destinations from the same navConfig SSOT).

## [1.47.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- PrivacyNotice: enlarged the "?" disclosure control from 18px to 22px (34px
  effective with the tap44 hit-expansion) and raised its contrast
  (text-secondary), improving tappability and discoverability of the privacy
  details.

## [1.47.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- Reusable `PrivacyNotice` component + single privacy source of truth
  (`data/privacyNotice`): a subtle "ההקלטה שלך מאובטחת" line with a "?"
  disclosure whose items are DERIVED from the app's real capabilities
  (`resolvePrivacyCapabilities`) — local-only storage / no transmission /
  audio-for-transcription-only / full user controls in this client build; a
  wired backend flips to server-storage + HTTPS with audio-retention omitted
  (unknown, never asserted). Falls back to a generic message when no capability
  metadata resolves. Accessible disclosure (aria-expanded/-controls, Escape +
  outside-click close, 44px hit target), RTL-safe.
- Help & Support: searchable FAQ (with a no-match empty state) + a
  Privacy & Security section that reuses the same privacy SSOT.

### Changed
- Removed the "?" help icon from the global app bar; Help stays reachable from
  the sidebar nav, ⌘K palette, and global search (one navConfig source).
- Upload privacy block consolidated into the shared `PrivacyNotice` (removes the
  duplicated inline points list + an hrefless policy anchor).

## [1.46.3] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Form selects standardized to one reusable implementation (`.app-select` in
  global.css): every native `<select>` (patient/duration/recurrence pickers in
  the schedule dialog, upload patient + meeting-date, roster/report/history
  filters) now shares one box — 44px height, 1.5px `--border-input`, 10px
  radius, 14.5px, `--paper` surface, `--text` — replacing the prior mix of
  1px/1.5px borders, `--border-input`/`--divider` colors, and 14/14.5 fonts.
  Verified: all nine selects share one computed signature, theme-aware in
  light+dark, native chevron kept (correctly RTL-placed). Removed the now-dead
  `.mh-patient-select` rule.

## [1.46.2] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Upload screen: the demo-only "הדגמת שגיאת פורמט" trigger was an anchor
  without href (keyboard-reachable only via the runtime a11y shim). Converted
  to a native `<button>` with a link-styling reset — same appearance, now
  focusable and Enter/Space-activatable at the source (WCAG 2.1.1).

## [1.46.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Truthfulness sweep: removed every unverifiable claim from UI copy — the
  login screen's "מוצפן מקצה לקצה · תואם תקני אבטחת מידע רפואי", the upload
  screen's AES-256/PII/access-control privacy points, the FAQ's RBAC/audit-log/
  "privacy settings" answers, and the summary caption's "ניקוי PII" — all
  replaced with honest local-only-demo statements; the stated upload cap now
  matches the real backend limit (25MB, was 200MB). A new guard test bans the
  claims from returning.

## [1.46.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Settings: the locked "שפה" tab was removed (the product is Hebrew-only by
  design — a permanently-locked setting was dead UI); "מראה" renamed to
  "ערכת נושא" everywhere (tab, pane heading, docs) for one consistent term.
- Help & Support is now a full support hub: FAQ · new troubleshooting section
  (rejected files, offline work, cross-device data, stale-version recovery) ·
  keyboard shortcuts · contact + new feedback CTA · about/legal card (honest
  local-data + AI-demo disclosure, privacy contact) · live app version.

## [1.45.2] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Upload flow: "תאריך הפגישה" is now date-only (DD/MM/YY) — the meeting picker
  no longer shows a time component anywhere in the flow; the selected calendar
  date is read as local Y/M/D so it never shifts across time zones (regression
  test added).

## [1.45.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Test/TDD hardening: the API service layer (`src/services/`) is now inside the
  CI coverage gate, with new deterministic suites for the auth bootstrap
  (register → token → storage → best-effort logout) and the XHR upload path
  (UUID guards, exact multipart contract fields, 400/404/409/413/415 mapping)
  — 17 new tests, 518 total. Coverage thresholds ratcheted 70% → 75%
  (measured ~81%).

## [1.45.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Session-details dialog redesigned for desktop: 840px canvas, meta fields
  (תאריך/שעה/מטופל/מיקום) in a responsive two-column card, description only
  when present, and all actions in one row — primary מעבר לתיק המטופל,
  secondary העלאת הקלטה/דוח הכנה/עריכה, tertiary סגירה, destructive מחיקת
  הפגישה kept at the opposite edge.
- Daily audio recap (סיכום יומי) is now a filled primary button in the home
  calendar toolbar (with pressed state), matching its role as the main CTA
  after the upcoming-session card.

## [1.44.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Backend integration hardening against the verified senseiapi contract
  (`github.com/avitalg/senseiAPI` is the single source of truth; full map +
  gap report in docs/INTEGRATION.md):
  - `PATCH /patients/{id}` now sends only `phone`/`email` (the backend 422'd on
    the old archive PATCH); `name`/`address` edits merge client-side.
  - Archive/restore are explicit client-side lifecycle transforms — no more
    failing requests, and the archive screen no longer risks showing the full
    roster (the backend has no archive filter).
  - Summary polling is GET-only (the backend route is read-only); a 404 maps to
    a clear "אין עדיין סיכום" message instead of a POST that could never work.
  - Prep-report polling detects the absent backend route (404/405 → coded
    NOT_AVAILABLE) and quietly falls back to the local report.
  - Audio upload sends exactly the contract form fields (`file`, UUID
    `patient_id`, UUID `meeting_id`); local seed ids never reach the API; new
    Hebrew messages for 413 (25MB cap) and 415 (unsupported type).
  - Sign-out now also invalidates the Bearer token server-side
    (best-effort `POST /auth/logout`).
- New contract-lock test suite (`tests/apiContract.test.ts`) pins routes,
  methods, payload shapes, and env-only base URLs to the backend contract.

## [1.43.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Dark theme: the sidebar brand title and profile name were nearly invisible
  (1.12:1 — `--paper` resolves dark in dark theme); they now use the on-ink
  text token (guarded by a test).
- Off-canvas nav drawer (≤860px band): background scroll now locks while the
  drawer is open, focus moves into the drawer and Tab is trapped inside it
  (WCAG 2.4.3), and closing returns focus to the menu toggle — matching the
  mobile shell's behavior.
- Drawer width is now viewport-responsive (`min(256px, 86vw)`), preventing
  overflow on very narrow screens.

## [1.43.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — the dataset's core-belief trajectory on the patient file (ציר האמונה)

The last unshipped dataset artifact: the core-belief trajectory · the patient's
central belief restated across treatment ("אני הרגתי את אבא שלי" ‹ "לא הייתה לי
כוונה ולא הייתה לי שליטה" ‹ "צלק ניצל את האסון · אני הייתי ילד שרצה לשרוד").
It renders as a quiet one-line strip directly under the treatment arc on the
patient file · the clinical transformation in a single glance, latest belief
emphasized. Same honesty gates as the arc: bespoke dataset content only
(`beliefTrajectory` in the per-patient content schema; null for generic
patients · no fabricated trajectories), shown only when the arc qualifies.
Covered by a new data test (earliest/latest order + null gate); live-verified on
Simba and absent on p1. Also repaired the changelog history: the touch-target
release was renumbered 1.41.3 and reordered newest-first (it had duplicated the
1.42.0 heading from a parallel work stream).

## [1.42.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — sidebar stabilization: dynamic viewport, Settings pinned last, drawer focus-restore

- **Dynamic viewport height.** The sidebar now sizes with `100dvh` (with a
  `100vh` fallback) in both the desktop rail and the mobile drawer, so it fits
  the *visible* viewport under mobile browser chrome, zoom, and rotation; the
  footer absorbs `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`. Height moved from inline style
  to the `.app-sidebar` rule (CSS owns the fallback chain).
- **Settings is the final menu item.** The pinned utility group now orders
  עזרה ותמיכה → הגדרות, keeping Settings anchored at the bottom of the nav and
  always visible (the group was already pinned; only the order changed).
- **Drawer focus-restore (WCAG focus management).** Closing the mobile drawer
  (scrim tap, Escape, navigation) returns focus to the menu button that opened
  it — keyboard/screen-reader users are never stranded in a hidden panel.

Validated on short (520px) and tall (1000px) screens: the sidebar equals the
viewport exactly, only the navigation body scrolls (no double scrollbars, no
horizontal overflow), Settings stays visible and last, and the sidebar
contributes zero extra page height. New regression test for the focus-restore;
nav-order guard updated.

## [1.41.3] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — touch-target floor (44px) across the mobile shell + landscape audit

Cross-device gate (desktop / mobile portrait+landscape / tablet portrait+
landscape). Landscape orientations audited for the first time: zero overflow on
all key routes at 812×375 and 1024×768. The objective fixes, all measured:

- **New `.tap44` utility** (shared invisible hit-expansion, same technique as
  the agenda "+") applied to: the mobile menu button (40→~48 effective), the
  welcome-banner CTA + close (34→~44; close also 30→34 visually to clear the
  floor), the resume-draft chip (32→~42+), and the list delete buttons
  (`pat-del-btn`, 30→~42 — harmless on desktop).
- **Sidebar logout icon 24→44** effective (padding+negative-margin, zero layout
  shift) — the worst offender, deferred twice, now closed.
- **Sidebar nav links 43→45** (padding +1px).
- **Next-session card CTAs 38→44.**

No visual redesign; layouts and spacing unchanged except the two deliberate
size bumps. Verified by elementFromPoint probes on the running app.

## [1.41.2] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — same white-border class on calendar events + a codebase-wide guard

Hunting the remaining instances of the v1.41.1 bug class (a `<button>` styling
only a directional border inherits the UA default border — white in dark mode):

- **Calendar event blocks** (home week/day grid) carried 2px pure-white UA
  borders on three sides in dark mode; only the category accent bar was
  intended. `border: none` reset added.
- **Static guard generalized**: the regression test now scans *every* `<button>`
  in `src/` — any directional border without a `border` reset in the same style
  fails CI (jsdom has no UA stylesheet, so this class is only catchable
  statically). Current codebase: zero offenders.

Full verification matrix for the Session History screens (directory +
per-patient): dark ✓ light ✓ mobile ✓ desktop ✓ search-empty state ✓ — zero
unintended light borders anywhere; the only remaining light strokes app-wide are
the intentional sidebar section hairlines and the notifications unread accent.

## [1.41.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — white borders around the session-history directory rows (dark mode)

The all-patients history directory rows are `<button>` elements whose inline
style overrode only `borderTop` — the browser's **default button border** leaked
through on the other three sides and rendered **pure white** in dark mode (the
reported "white boxes" around each row). The style now resets `border: none`
before applying the top divider. App-wide dark-mode border sweep across all 16
routes confirms the only remaining light strokes are intentional: the sidebar's
8%-alpha section hairlines (design, on the ink panel — not in any table) and the
notifications unread accent bar. Verified clean in light + dark; static
regression guard added (`tests/printLayout.test.ts`) since jsdom carries no UA
stylesheet and cannot catch this class at runtime.

## [1.41.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — star icons removed · one date format (DD/MM/YY) · session-history separators fixed

- **Star icons removed** from every button and section header that carried them
  (prep-report "יצירת דוח" button; the "סקירה מהירה", "תובנות מרכזיות",
  "סיכום פגישה", and "נושאים מרכזיים" headers — including the two icon boxes
  that would otherwise have been left empty). Labels, spacing, and alignment
  unchanged (flex-gap layouts collapse cleanly). The notifications list keeps its
  tiny AI-summary *category* marker (a list-item icon, not a button).
- **One date format everywhere: `DD/MM/YY`** (e.g. `22/06/26`). Replaced every
  dot-separated builder: session-history dates (seed + parser kept in sync),
  upload meeting-date options, the home week-range title, prep-report date chips
  and generated-at stamp, the "מאז MM/YY" patient-since and archive
  treatment-span (MM/YY–MM/YY), and the relative-date fallback (DD/MM). New
  canonical `fmtDate` / `fmtDayMonth` in `utils/dates.ts`; internal ISO keys
  (`YYYY-MM-DD` dayKeys, export filenames) are identifiers, not displayed dates,
  and are unchanged.
- **Session-history separators.** Two real artifacts fixed: rows drew a border
  above the FIRST row (a stray full-width line at the top of the list), and the
  separator used `--line` — which in light mode is near-white (#EAF1FB on a white
  card). Rows now separate only between items using the standard `--divider`
  token — a deliberate subtle divider in light (#DBE6F4) and properly dark in
  dark mode (#213655). Applied to both the session list and the all-patients
  history directory; verified by computed-style measurement in both themes.

Tests updated (patient-since/span, Simba report date). Full gate green
(tsc strict, lint, 488 tests, dup, build); browser-verified across screens.

## [1.40.0] — 2026-07-18

### Removed — direct (in-browser) meeting recording; upload is now the sole capture path

Per request, the option to record meetings directly is gone across both shells;
capturing a session is now done by **uploading a recording file** (the primary,
backend-ready path — unchanged).

- **Desktop UploadPage**: removed the "הקלטה ישירה" tab and the whole recording
  UI; the screen is file-upload only (title "העלאת פגישה", copy updated). No
  behavioral change to the upload/transcribe/summary pipeline.
- **Mobile**: removed the day-view mic quick-action and the full-screen recording
  overlay; the prep-report footer's "התחל הקלטה" is now **"העלאת הקלטה"**
  (navigates to the upload flow). Mobile capture routes to the shared UploadPage.
- **Deleted** the now-orphaned `MobileRecording` component, the `useAudioRecorder`
  hook, `buildMockRecordingFile`, three record-only mobile icons (Mic/Play/Pause),
  the `.mob-record*` CSS, and the `uploadInputMode` state.
- **Security tightened**: `Permissions-Policy` reverts to `microphone=()` (fully
  denied) on both hosts — the app no longer requests the microphone.
- **Nav label** "העלאה והקלטה" → "העלאת פגישה" (route title too), for consistency.

Bundle shrank ~2KB gzip. Tests updated (upload/mobile/security/a11y) to assert the
removal; full gate green (tsc strict, lint, 488 tests, dup, build). Browser-
verified on desktop + mobile.

## [1.39.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — mobile day-strip shows meeting dots

The phone home's 14-day strip gave no hint which days hold meetings — the
therapist had to tap day-by-day, while the desktop month view already shows
count badges. Each strip day now carries the standard calendar dot indicator,
driven by the locally-scheduled appointments (the patient-tied truth): filled
`--primary` on days with meetings (inverts to `--on-accent` on the selected
day), an invisible placeholder elsewhere so the strip's vertical rhythm never
shifts. Screen readers get "· יש פגישות" on dotted days.

Live-verified (dots exactly on the four appointment days, none elsewhere;
layout unchanged). Covered by a new case in `tests/mobileDayView.test.tsx`.

## [1.39.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — treatment arc on the patient file (the dataset's "מפת התהליך")

The session dataset's headline artifact — the treatment map (phase arc
ייצוב → הכנה → עיבוד קוגניטיבי → עיבוד → אינטגרציה) — existed per-session in the
app but the arc itself was never shown anywhere. The patient file's session
history now opens with a compact **"מהלך הטיפול"** strip: each session's phase as
a chip in chronological order, the latest phase highlighted — the clinical story
at a glance before drilling into any single session.

Honestly data-driven: renders **only** for patients with real per-session
content (`sessionMeta` returns null otherwise — no fabricated arcs for the
generic demo patients), and only when every session has a phase. Verified live
on Simba (the exact dataset arc, RTL-correct) and absent on p1.

Covered by new cases in `tests/patientSessionContent.test.ts` (chronological
order ייצוב→אינטגרציה; null-gate for patients without content).

## [1.38.0] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — the full search screen was unreachable (orphaned route reconnected)

Product audit for orphaned pages / dead routes. Finding: the full search screen
(route `search` · "תוצאות חיפוש") — which matches patients **and sessions** and
offers type filters (all / patients / sessions) — had **no in-app entry point**.
Its state (`searchQuery`/`searchType`) was written only by the screen itself, the
app bar has no search field, and nothing navigated to it; it was reachable only by
typing `#/search`. It's tested, working, and richer than the palette's inline
results — so the fix is to reconnect it, not delete it (deleting would drop the
session-search capability).

- The ⌘K palette now shows a **"חיפוש מלא: ״…״ ›"** escalation row whenever there's
  a query — the sole, canonical entry point (the screen intentionally has no
  sidebar item). It carries the query over and lands on the full results with
  session matches the palette doesn't rank inline. Complementary to the palette,
  not a duplicate surface.
- Keyboard-reachable (appended to the palette's action list; arrow-navigable,
  Enter-activates) and the empty-quick-results copy now points to it
  ("נסו חיפוש מלא לתוצאות מהפגישות").

Verified live (palette query → escalation → `#/search` with 4 session results).
Covered by two new cases in `tests/commandPalette.test.tsx` (escalation reaches
the screen; keyboard path). Route/page inventory otherwise complete — no other
orphaned, dead, or unreachable destinations.

## [1.37.3] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — a stale patient link no longer opens a DIFFERENT patient's file

Edge-case bug audit (invalid deep links, empty-data conditions, hostile inputs).
One high-severity find: a URL naming an unknown patient — a bookmark or shared
link to a patient deleted since, or a hand-edited hash — fell through to
`getPatient`'s first-patient fallback and silently rendered **someone else's
clinical file under the wrong URL** (the URL-vector sibling of the R-1 ghost
bug). Both deep-link entry points (fresh load and runtime hash change) now
validate the patient against the roster (active + archived) in offline mode:
an unknown id lands on the patients roster with an honest notice
("המטופל שבקישור לא נמצא · ייתכן שנמחק"); valid links are untouched. With an
API configured, validation stays server-side (the roster loads async).

Also probed and clean: an empty roster is unreachable in demo (the reconciler
re-seeds), out-of-range session numbers wrap safely, and long names are
ellipsis-guarded.

Covered by `tests/unknownPatientLink.test.tsx` (mount vector, runtime vector,
valid-link control).

## [1.37.2] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — mobile quick-actions "+" reaches a 44px touch target

Touch-interaction pass over the 25-dimension experience review (everything else
in that mandate maps to work already shipped and guarded this cycle). The one
deferred item: the mobile agenda's expand-actions chip — the most-tapped control
on the phone — measured 34×34px (passes WCAG 2.2 AA target-size, but below the
44px touch guideline). The visible chip is unchanged; an invisible pseudo-element
overlay extends the TAP area to an effective ~44px (measured: taps 4px outside
every edge of the chip now hit the button). No layout shift, no visual change.

## [1.37.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — progressive disclosure: the notes timeline previews the latest 4

Disclosure audit across the product. One real gap: the between-session notes
timeline rendered **all** entries unbounded — notes accumulate indefinitely by
design, so over months the card would swallow the patient file, while every
sibling list already discloses progressively (sessions preview 5 + "כל
ההיסטוריה", upcoming meetings preview 5). The timeline now shows the latest 4
with the same canonical pattern: "הצגת כל ההערות (N) ›" expands in place
(`aria-expanded`), and "הצגת ההערות האחרונות בלבד" collapses back.

Everything else already discloses well (verified): dismissible first-run banner,
conditional focus cards (drafts / follow-ups appear only when relevant),
settings tabs, collapsed share/TTS affordances, capped focus lists, ⌘K for
power navigation, and the documents card's category filter.

Covered by a new case in `tests/therapistNotesTimeline.test.tsx`
(preview → expand → collapse). Live-verified.

## [1.37.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — backend readiness: calendar load failures are visible and retryable

Frontend optimization pass focused on the backend-transition seam. The gap: a
failed week-events load (`useWeekEvents`) was swallowed into an empty array — 
with a real API, a failed `/calendar` request would render as "אין פגישות"
(silent data loss) instead of an error. Unreachable in demo mode (the fixture
never fails), but exactly the state that would have forced a UX retrofit at
integration time.

- `useWeekEvents` now exposes `error` + `reload()` (retry re-fires the load;
  aborts are not errors; success clears the flag).
- Desktop home: an inline `role="alert"` strip under the calendar toolbar — 
  "טעינת היומן נכשלה. הפגישות המקומיות עדיין מוצגות." + "ניסיון חוזר" (honest:
  locally-scheduled appointments still render, only the remote layer failed).
- Mobile day view: the same compact strip above the list.
- Both shells share the single hook — one failure model, no divergence.

Covered by `tests/weekEventsError.test.tsx` (mocked API rejection → strip +
retry → recovery). The rest of the mandate was verified in the preceding passes
(states, IA, forms, a11y, responsive, RTL, consistency — all guarded).

## [1.36.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — design-system consistency: one page-title style everywhere

A measured consistency audit (computed styles harvested across all 10 routes in
the live app, outlier analysis rather than eyeballing) found one real
inconsistency: **two page-title styles** — eight screens at 27px/900 while the
dashboard greeting and the patient-file name sat at 24px/800. Both normalized to
the majority 27px/900 (−0.6px letter-spacing); DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §1 corrected
(it had recorded the minority value); and a new guard
(`tests/typographyConsistency.test.tsx`, 7 routes) pins the canonical scale so a
new screen can't introduce a third size.

Everything else measured clean or by-design: button radii cluster on the
documented 7–10px scale (3 negligible outliers among ~130 buttons), heights
cluster on the compact/action/form tiers, the 594px "buttons" are the invisible
calendar slot-targets (intentional), colors are token-ratchet-guarded, and
interaction states are defined globally.

## [1.36.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — restore from backup ("שחזור מגיבוי") — completes the data-ownership story

The v1.35.0 export was a backup you couldn't restore — for a localStorage-only
app, that isn't real data ownership (clearing browser data still lost
everything). Settings › Profile › "הנתונים שלך" now has the counterpart:

- **שחזור מגיבוי** — pick an exported JSON file; it is validated as a Sensei
  backup (valid JSON + recognizable record shape; anything else is rejected with
  a specific error and touches nothing).
- **Explicit confirmation** before any write ("השחזור יחליף את כל הנתונים…"),
  with cancel — no accidental replacement.
- On confirm the record is written and the app rehydrates via a full reload, so
  the normal restore path (normalization, migrations, demo reconciliation) runs
  exactly as on any startup.

Covered by two new cases in `tests/dataExport.test.tsx`: a full export→restore
round-trip (no write before confirmation; restored content lands in the store)
and rejection of a non-backup file. Live-verified end-to-end (pick → confirm →
reload → restored patient visible in the roster).

## [1.35.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — data export in Settings › Profile ("הנתונים שלך")

Responsive/RTL/preferences audit across desktop, tablet, and mobile. The one
genuine gap: users had no way to take their data with them. A new "הנתונים שלך"
section (above the danger zone, deliberately adjacent to deletion) downloads the
full locally-persisted record — patients, appointments, notes timeline, drafts,
documents, preferences — as a dated, pretty-printed JSON file
(`sensei-data-YYYY-MM-DD.json`) via the canonical download path (UTF-8 BOM for
Hebrew). Data ownership for a local-first clinical tool; complements the
existing per-item downloads (transcript, letter print).

Audit results, all clean (no fixes needed):
- **Responsive:** zero horizontal overflow on all 10 key routes × 3 breakpoints
  (375 / 768 / 1280) — 30/30; touch targets meet WCAG 2.2 AA target-size
  (2.5.8; the 34px agenda "+" noted as below the 44px AAA guideline, accepted).
- **RTL:** direction, alignment, and LTR islands (phones, times, emails) verified
  live; enforced continuously by the logical-properties + copy guards.
- **Accessibility preferences:** already a dedicated Settings tab (font size,
  contrast, motion, reading, focus) persisted via `data-a11y-*`.
- **Discovery:** first-run welcome → core flow, ⌘K palette with recents,
  keyboard-shortcuts dialog — progressive, no manual needed.
- **Profile:** identity editing with validation + dirty-state, Google connection
  status, danger zone — complete.

Covered by `tests/dataExport.test.tsx` (dated filename, parseable JSON, content
round-trip, confirmation toast).

## [1.34.0] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — user-journey audit: the demo upload flow was a dead end

Walked every key journey end-to-end in the running app (not per-screen criteria
— full task chains). One blocked journey found and fixed:

- **Demo mode's core flow (upload → AI outputs) was blocked.** "בחירת קובץ"
  always opened the native OS file picker — demanding a real audio file that a
  demo user doesn't have. The sample-recording affordance existed only on an
  empty drag-drop, which is undiscoverable. In demo mode the pick button now
  fabricates the sample recording (same path as the demo drop), so the journey
  completes: demo entry → upload → sample → mock pipeline → transcript → AI
  summary. Real builds keep the native picker (no phantom uploads — guarded).

Journeys verified whole and unbroken: morning-open (home recap → prep report),
scheduling (create via unified button → event dialog → **edit** → calendar
updates + toast), notes timeline + draft recovery, roster lifecycle
(create/archive/restore/permanent-delete, all previously test-verified), ⌘K
palette (search → jump to file), auth (logout → login → demo entry), and the
fixed upload chain — each driven live.

Covered by two new cases in `tests/uploadDropNoFile.test.tsx` (demo pick runs
the sample flow to the transcript; a real build's pick fabricates nothing).

## [1.33.0] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — production verification audit: two real defects found and fixed

A full spec-vs-running-app verification (every acceptance criterion driven in the
live application, not assumed from code) surfaced two genuine defects:

- **The all-patients history directory was unreachable (spec screen 4).** Once
  any patient was selected, the sidebar's "היסטוריית פגישות" always opened that
  patient's history, and the per-patient view offered no way back — the spec's
  required initial view (all patients A–Z + search) could never be reached in
  normal use. Two-part root cause: (1) the sidebar deliberately preserved the
  selected patient; (2) deeper — `navigate`'s hash mirror used
  `patch.patientId || current` so an **explicit null was overridden**, and the
  hashchange echo resurrected the stale patient into state. Fixed both: the
  sidebar entry now opens the directory (`patientId: null`), and the mirror
  treats a present-but-null `patientId` as authoritative. Per-patient history
  stays reachable from the patient file and deep links. Regression test added.
- **Multi-tab stale-overwrite in the v1.32.0 unload flush.** The pagehide flush
  wrote unconditionally, so a tab with nothing pending could clobber newer state
  written by another tab (or tooling) with its stale snapshot on close/reload.
  The flush now writes only when a debounced persist is actually pending
  (dirty-only). Regression test added (clean unload must not overwrite a newer
  write).

All five spec screens re-verified against the running app: home recap + three
actions + empty state; calendar day/week/month switching, slot-prefill creation,
event dialog (not a patients-tab jump); patient file (details once, overview
above the fold, documents, archive action); consolidated session screen
(insights · summary · topics · risk; no transcript, no recurring patterns);
archive behaviors per 5.1–5.6. 467 tests green.

## [1.32.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — de-duplication: one canonical home for Hebrew calendar names + time helpers

System-wide duplication audit. The jscpd guard catches block-level clones, but
small copy-pasted constants/one-liners sat under its radar and had already begun
to drift in naming (`HE_DOW` vs `HE_DAYS_SHORT`, `MON`, `fmt` vs `fmtTime`):

- **`fmtTime` (HH:MM) existed 8×** — DashboardPage, MobileDayView,
  UpcomingMeetingList (exported), CalendarPage (`fmt`), Dialogs
  (`fmtEventTime`), UploadPage, ReportPage (inline), services/calendar (2×
  inline) → now one canonical `src/utils/dates.ts` implementation.
- **`sameDay` existed 2×**, **`HE_MONTHS` 2×**, **weekday initials 2×**
  (`HE_DAYS_SHORT`/`HE_DOW`), **full weekday names 2×**
  (`HE_DAYS`/`HE_WEEKDAYS`), plus CalendarPage's in-month form (`MON` →
  `HE_MONTHS_IN`) — all consolidated into the same module.

Behavior-identical (same strings, same formatting); every consumer updated; the
canonical map in ARCHITECTURE.md registers the new module. Verified by the full
suite (462 tests — including the screens that render these labels), tsc strict,
lint, duplication guard, and a production build.

## [1.32.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — cache & update safety: bounded auto-recovery, unload flush, version log

Cache/update-safety audit (deploy-while-users-are-active). The foundation was
already in place and CI-guarded — immutable hashed assets + must-revalidate HTML
on both hosts, no Service Worker (by design), stale-chunk detection with a
Hebrew "new version" recovery card. Three minimal additions close the gaps:

- **Bounded automatic recovery.** A verified stale-chunk mismatch (old chunk hash
  gone after a deploy) now reloads **once** automatically — fresh HTML brings the
  current hashes. A per-tab `sessionStorage` flag bounds it to a single retry: if
  the chunk still fails (broken deploy), no reload loop — the manual recovery
  card takes over. Multi-tab safe (each tab recovers independently).
- **Unload flush (unsaved-work protection).** Store persistence is debounced
  (500ms); a reload/close inside that window dropped the last keystrokes. A
  synchronous flush on `pagehide`/`beforeunload` closes the loss window — which
  also makes the automatic reload above safe by construction.
- **Version observability.** `__APP_VERSION__` (from package.json via Vite
  `define`) logged once at boot (`[sensei] v1.32.0`, non-PII) so stale-client
  reports can be correlated with a release; the auto-reload also logs its
  recovery action.

Covered by `tests/errorBoundary.test.tsx` (auto-reload once → bounded → manual
fallback) and `tests/persistFlush.test.tsx` (pagehide persists un-debounced
changes immediately). Cache-Control split remains guarded in
`tests/canonical.test.ts`; security headers in `tests/securityHeaders.test.ts`.

## [1.31.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — security audit: Permissions-Policy no longer blocks in-browser recording

Full frontend security audit (production gate). One real defect found and fixed:

- **Permissions-Policy `microphone=()` denied the microphone to our own origin**
  (both `public/_headers` and `vercel.json`), which would silently break the
  in-browser recording flow (`useAudioRecorder` → `getUserMedia`) in production
  while local dev (no headers) worked. Now `microphone=(self)` — our origin only;
  camera/geolocation/payment/USB stay fully denied.
- New regression guard `tests/securityHeaders.test.ts`: microphone-self + denials,
  Netlify↔Vercel header parity (no config drift), strict CSP invariants
  (self-only scripts, no eval, no framing, no plugins), HSTS + nosniff.

Audit results otherwise clean: no XSS sinks (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/
`innerHTML`/`eval`), no secrets in source (the demo password is public demo data
by design), no source maps in the production bundle, no console leftovers,
0 prod-dependency vulnerabilities, `window.open` uses `noopener,noreferrer`,
deep links cannot bypass sign-in (guarded), upload inputs are validated, and the
error boundary renders no stack traces. Residual risk documented in Known debt:
the dormant API auth layer keeps its token in web storage — prefer httpOnly
cookies when a real backend is wired.

## [1.31.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — mobile home: workload line + draft recovery reach the phone

Closes the last noted desktop/mobile parity gap from the UX audit. Under the
phone-home greeting:

- **Workload line** — today's and this week's session counts at a glance
  ("2 פגישות היום · 6 פגישות השבוע"), from the same shared `dashboardStats`
  source as the desktop strip, so the two shells always agree.
- **Resume-draft chip** — an unsaved note/summary draft is now visible and
  recoverable from the phone ("טיוטה שלא נשמרה · שם המטופל", tap → the patient
  file), not only from the desktop "להמשך עבודה" card. Work-loss protection is
  no longer desktop-only.

Also audited the document head/SEO layer as part of the production-readiness
pass: `lang/dir`, meta description, canonical, Open Graph/Twitter tags, and the
runtime `theme-color` strategy are all present and correct (og:image asset
verified) — no changes needed.

Covered by `tests/mobileDayView.test.tsx` (workload line renders; draft chip
opens the patient file).

## [1.30.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — mobile home: an empty day now surfaces the next session (UX audit)

From an end-to-end UX audit: on the phone home, a day with no meetings previously
showed only a sun icon and "אין פגישות ביום זה" above a large expanse of dead
space — the phone's most valuable content (who's next, and how to prep) was
desktop-only. The empty state now surfaces the therapist's **next upcoming session**
across days — patient name, relative time ("מחר · 09:00"), and one-tap "הכנה
לפגישה" / "פתיחת התיק" — so the phone home is never a dead end. If there is no
upcoming session at all, it offers the core "העלאת הקלטה" action instead. Reuses
the shared `dashboardStats` source, so desktop and mobile agree on "next".

Covered by `tests/mobileDayView.test.tsx` (empty-day → next-session card + prep nav).

## [1.29.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — full TypeScript `strict` mode enabled (tracked debt cleared)

`tsconfig` now runs full `strict` (strict null checks, implicit-any, strict
function types, etc.) instead of only the independent safety flags. The port
originated from an untyped prototype, but the strict fallout turned out small —
**four** real fixes, all behavior-preserving:

- `sessionSummaryText(p)` typed `{ id?: string } | undefined` instead of `unknown`.
- `submitUpload` captures the `meetingId` guard result in a `const` so the
  Promise-executor closure keeps the non-undefined type.
- `patientSessions` session-row `onDelete` uses optional-chained
  `e?.stopPropagation?.()` (the handler is optional).

No runtime behavior changes; `npm run build` now enforces strict. Also removed a
stale "Outcomes screen" entry from the README known-debt list (no such screen
exists in this app).

## [1.29.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — therapist between-session notes as a dated timeline (spec 3.6)

Resolves the spec's open question on where the therapist's between-session notes
should live. The single free-text notes blob in the patient file is now a
**dated, append-only timeline**: "הוספת הערה" opens a composer, saving appends a
timestamped entry (newest first), and each entry can be deleted individually — so
observations accumulate with temporal context instead of overwriting one field.

- **Non-destructive migration.** Any existing single-blob note is surfaced as a
  migrated "legacy" entry (stable id) and folded into the timeline array on the
  first edit — no note is lost. New pure `deriveNotes/addNote/removeNote` helpers
  (`utils/therapistNotes.ts`) keep the logic single-sourced and unit-tested.
- **Draft safety preserved.** The composer still writes to `notesDrafts[pid]`, so
  an interrupted note survives (recovery banner) and still surfaces in the home
  "resume work" card — unchanged behavior.
- **Referential integrity.** `therapistNotes` is added to the permanent-delete
  purge (R-1) so a hard-deleted patient leaves no orphaned notes.

Covered by `tests/therapistNotes.test.ts` (unit) and
`tests/therapistNotesTimeline.test.tsx` (add / migrate / delete); the four
draft-recovery guards still pass against the new model.

## [1.28.1] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — Home workload strip: tile visual balance

UI polish from a home-screen review. The at-a-glance workload tiles previously
stretched to fill the row (`flex: 1 1 160px`), so each tile's content hugged the
start and left ~90px of dead space inside it — pronounced in the common 2-tile
state, where two half-width slabs showed a lone large "0". Tiles are now sized to
their content with a shared `min-width` (uniform, compact chips aligned to the
start), so the row reads as balanced whether it shows 2 or 4 tiles. The
follow-ups tile's chevron now sits directly after its label instead of being
pushed to the far edge. Measured before/after and verified in light and dark.
No behavior or DOM change (CSS only); all 444 tests still pass.

## [1.28.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — TTS Patient Recap in the patient file (spec 3.3)

Completes the "listen to a recap without opening things" story, now at the
patient-file level: alongside upload / schedule / prep-report on an active
patient's header, a play control speaks that patient's previous-session summary
ahead of the upcoming meeting. Consistent with the home agenda's per-session
playback (v1.27.0) and built on the same browser-native `useTts` (no backend).

- Flips to a labelled stop toggle while playing (`aria-pressed`).
- Hidden when the Web Speech API is absent, or when the patient has no prior
  session summary — no dead button.
- Offered on active files only (archived files keep their reduced action set per
  spec 5.3).

Covered by `tests/patientRecapTts.test.tsx`.

## [1.27.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — per-session recap playback on the home agenda (spec 1.2, "השמעה למפגש זה")

The last unbuilt element of the screens spec's Home section. Each agenda row's
quick actions now include a play control that speaks the patient's name, session
time, and the FULL previous-session summary — "to listen to in the car or in the
morning without opening patient files." Client-side Web Speech (the existing
`useTts`), no backend: the spec deferred this only because backend TTS wasn't in
development, but this app's TTS is browser-native.

- Shares the page's single TTS instance with the daily recap — starting one stops
  the other; the daily-recap toolbar button reflects only its own playback.
- The playing row's control flips to a stop toggle (`aria-pressed`, labelled).
- Hidden entirely when the Web Speech API is absent — no dead button.

Covered by `tests/sessionRecapTts.test.tsx` (speaks name + summary, stop toggle,
unsupported-API fallback).

## [1.26.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — Home dashboard: at-a-glance workload, smarter focus zone, calendar a11y

A comprehensive improvement pass on the home screen, all reading from the same
patient-tied data (locally-scheduled appointments), not the decorative calendar
fixture.

- **At-a-glance workload strip.** A new calm, glanceable row above the calendar:
  today's sessions and this week's total (always shown), plus open drafts and
  patients awaiting a follow-up (shown only when there's something to act on).
  The follow-ups tile is actionable and opens the patients list. New shared,
  unit-tested `dashboardStats()` / `openDraftPids()` helpers keep the strip and
  the focus zone reporting identical numbers.
- **Smarter focus zone.** Alongside "next session" and "resume drafts", the
  attention layer now surfaces active patients with no upcoming appointment
  ("לתיאום פגישה"), each with a one-tap schedule action — shown only when
  relevant.
- **Calendar accessibility.** View/date changes (week/day/month navigation) are
  now announced to screen readers via a polite live region, skipping the initial
  render so it only speaks in response to a user action. New `.sr-only` utility.
- **Visual polish.** Consistent card radius, shadow, spacing rhythm, and tokenized
  colors across the new strip and focus cards; reduced-motion respected.

Covered by `tests/dashboardStats.test.ts` and `tests/dashboardSummary.test.tsx`;
existing focus-zone and calendar guards still pass.

## [1.25.0] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — referential integrity on permanent delete (R-1) + soft duplicate guard (R-2)

Two data-integrity improvements from a read-only deduplication/integrity audit.

- **R-1 — no orphaned references on permanent delete.** Permanently deleting an
  archived patient now atomically purges every reference to that patient id across
  all pid-keyed collections (appointments, note/overview/summary overrides + drafts,
  documents, transcripts, session notes, deleted-session tombstones, recent list,
  active-transcript pointer). Previously these lingered, and an orphaned appointment
  would resolve to `patients[0]` via the `getPatient` fallback and render as a ghost
  under the wrong patient. New pure `purgePatientReferences()` helper is
  deterministic and idempotent (a no-op once clean), applied on both the API and
  offline delete paths. Covered by `tests/patientReferences.test.ts` (unit) and a
  new end-to-end case in `tests/patientLifecycle.test.tsx`.
- **R-2 — soft duplicate-patient warning on creation.** When a new patient's phone
  or email matches an existing record (ignoring formatting / letter case), the
  create form surfaces a non-blocking warning naming the possible match. It never
  prevents a legitimate save (shared family numbers and re-adds are valid). Covered
  by `tests/patientDuplicateWarning.test.tsx`.

## [1.24.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — session patient-state (final dataset field)

Wires the last unused v3-dataset field, patient_state (מצב המטופל), onto Simba's session detail — shown on the sessions that have it (assessment + integration). This exhausts every field in the dataset schema. Guarded by the updated tests/patientSessionContent.test.ts.

## [1.23.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — Home dashboard redesign: attention-first workspace

Re-architected the home around what the therapist needs *now*, above the (still
fully functional) calendar.

- **Contextual, time-aware greeting.** Shared `heGreeting()` helper covers night /
  morning / noon / afternoon / evening ("אחר צהריים טובים, ד״ר רותם שגב"),
  personalized with the display name — one source, used by desktop and mobile.
- **New "Focus" zone** (`components/DashboardFocus.tsx`) leads the page:
  - **הפגישה הבאה** — the next upcoming session (patient, natural relative time via
    `relativeWhen()`, a "previously on" recap, and one-click הצגת דוח ההכנה /
    העלאת הקלטה / פתיחת התיק); calm empty state when nothing is scheduled.
  - **להמשך עבודה** — resume unsaved notes/summary drafts (draft-recovery
    productivity); the card hides entirely when there's nothing to resume.
- **Clear IA & hierarchy** — greeting (h1) → Focus zone → a labelled "היומן שלך"
  calendar section; production Hebrew microcopy throughout; correct plurals.
- Reuses existing store/services (scheduledAppts, sessionSummaries, drafts) — no
  parallel state or duplicated logic. axe-clean (WCAG 2.2 AA), RTL, keyboard-
  navigable. Guarded by `tests/dashboardFocus.test.tsx`.

## [1.22.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — session focus + interventions from the dataset

Surfaces the last two structured clinical fields from the v3 dataset on Simba's
(p5) session detail: the session **focus** ("מוקד") and the **interventions**
("התערבויות", parsed into chips) — alongside the existing phase / protocol /
distress / homework. Extends `PatientSessionContent` + `sessionMeta`; generic
patients render none of it. Guarded by the updated `tests/patientSessionContent.test.ts`.

## [1.21.0] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed / Added — Hebrew count grammar + mobile home parity

- **Hebrew pluralization.** The number 1 was pairing with plural nouns
  ("1 פגישות היום", "1 מטופלים"). New `heCount(n, singular, plural)` helper fixes
  the count labels across the dashboard greeting, daily-recap TTS, month cells,
  the session-history directory/counts, and the patients/archive counts (e.g. now
  "פגישה אחת היום"). Guarded by `tests/heCount.test.ts`.
- **Mobile home parity.** The phone home now shows the same personalized greeting
  and dismissible first-run tip (→ the record/upload core flow) as the desktop
  dashboard, keeping the two shells consistent.

## [1.20.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — Patients roster: inline search + sort (UX friction fix)

The active Patients list had no way to search or reorder from the page (it read a
sort preference nothing could set). Added an inline **search** (name / phone /
email) with a "no results → clear" recovery, and a visible **sort control**
(א־ת / most-recent) whose choice now **persists** (`sortBy` added to the persisted
keys). Brings the roster to parity with the archive and history directories.
Guarded by `tests/patientsSearchSort.test.tsx`.

## [1.19.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — Patients list visual refresh (screen-3 scannability)

The patient roster reads more clearly and does more at a glance: each row now
leads with the name, shows the phone, and surfaces the patient's **next
appointment** as a chip (date · time) — or a clear "אין פגישה מתוכננת" state —
computed from the schedule. Replaces the dense "phone · email · since" line.
Guarded by `tests/patientListNextMeeting.test.tsx`.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — calendar drag-and-drop rescheduling (batch 4)

Locally-scheduled appointments can be **dragged to a new day/time** in the week and
day views; the appointment is updated in place (no duplicate), the target column
highlights while dragging, and a toast confirms the move. Fixture demo events
aren't draggable; **click-to-edit via the details dialog remains the keyboard-
accessible path**, so this is a pure enhancement. Guarded by
`tests/calendarDragDrop.test.tsx`.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — canonical Session History directory (batch 3)

Reaching "היסטוריית פגישות" with no patient selected now shows a **directory of all
patients — active and archived — sorted A–Z with search** (replacing the dropdown
picker). A row opens that patient's full history (the same `SessionHistoryView`
reached via Patients → patient → history), so there is one canonical experience.
Archived patients are labelled; each row shows the session count. Guarded by
`tests/sessionHistoryDirectory.test.tsx` (+ updated `uxTier2`).

## [1.16.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — patient Documents section (batch 2b)

Replaces the placeholder "documents" card with a real per-patient Documents
manager (`components/patient/PatientDocuments.tsx`):

- **Clinical letter** (built-in, opens the letter) + **uploaded documents**.
- **Upload** a file (real picker); small files keep their bytes as a data URI so
  **Download** works, larger files store metadata (real storage is backend scope).
- **Categorize** each document (מכתב קליני / הפניה / טופס / סיכום / אחר), **delete**,
  and **search** once the list grows.
- Persisted per patient (`documentsByPatient`). Guarded by
  `tests/patientDocuments.test.tsx`.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — patient profile: structured overview + therapist notes (batch 2a)

- **Structured Patient Overview** replaces the single free-text summary at the top
  of the file: four labelled sections — סיכום הטיפול הנוכחי · מטרות הטיפול המרכזיות ·
  אתגרים נוכחיים · הערות לקראת הפגישה הקרובה — seeded per patient (Simba/p5 bespoke)
  and editable in place; edits persist per patient (`overviewOverrides`). New
  `src/data/patientOverview.ts` (single source for the fields + defaults).
- **Dedicated Therapist Notes area** — the free-text between-session notes now live
  in their own "הערות המטפל" card (repurposed from the old summary card, keeping the
  unsaved-draft recovery), with an empty state.
- Guarded by `tests/patientOverview.test.tsx`; notes-draft test labels updated.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — production-refinement pass (batch 1)

Against the full product specification.

- **Personalized workspace greeting** on the home dashboard — time-aware
  ("בוקר טוב / צהריים טובים / ערב טוב, <therapist>") + today's date and load. The
  calendar range demotes to h2 for a clean h1→h2 order.
- **Edit an appointment from its details panel.** The meeting-details dialog gained
  an "עריכת הפגישה" action for locally-scheduled appointments; it opens the schedule
  dialog in edit mode (prefilled, recurrence hidden) and **updates the existing
  appointment in place** — no duplicate. Guarded by `tests/editAppointment.test.tsx`.
- **Archive-first for active patients.** Per spec, an active patient file offers
  "העברה לארכיון" (reversible) only; permanent deletion is now reserved for archived
  files. Tests updated accordingly.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — inline actions on the home "today's agenda" (screen-1.3 acceptance)

Each today's-agenda row now exposes the three per-session quick actions **inline,
without opening the file** — a patient-file button, an upload-recording button, and
a prep-report button — beneath the name/time/recap. Satisfies Screen-1.3 acceptance
criterion #2. The info area (recap) remains a separate button that opens the
meeting-details dialog, so no interactive controls are nested (axe-clean).
Guarded by the updated `tests/todayAgenda.test.tsx`.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — richer Simba dataset (v3) on the session-detail screen

Wires the structured fields from the v3 dataset into Simba's (p5) sessions and
surfaces them on the session-detail screen:

- **Phase / protocol / distress-trend chips** under the session title
  (e.g. "שלב: אינטגרציה · פרוטוקול: סיכום ומעקב · מצוקה: נמוכה ויציבה").
- **"משימה לבית" (homework) card** with each session's between-session task.
- Extended `PatientSessionContent` (`phases`/`protocols`/`distress`/`homework`) +
  a `sessionMeta()` accessor; generic patients render none of it. Guarded by the
  updated `tests/patientSessionContent.test.ts`.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — home "today's agenda" (screen-1 spec)

- **Today's agenda on the home screen.** A new "הפגישות שלך היום" card in the
  dashboard side panel lists today's meetings, each with a one-line "previously on"
  recap (the patient's latest session summary) under the name + time. Clicking a
  row opens the meeting-details dialog (recap + prep-report / upload / file
  actions) — directly fulfilling the spec's Screen-1 daily list. Guarded by
  `tests/todayAgenda.test.tsx`.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — UX audit, tier 3 (forms & error prevention)

- **Phone validation is real now.** New `isValidPhone` helper (in `utils`) enforces
  an Israeli phone shape — 9/10 digits or +972 — forgiving on separators. Previously
  any input ≥3 chars passed ("5" was accepted), silently entering bad data. The
  error message now shows the expected format. Guarded by `tests/phoneValidation.test.ts`.
- **Destructive action separated in the meeting-details dialog.** The "מחיקת הפגישה"
  button is pushed to the opposite edge (space-between) instead of sitting inline
  among the navigation actions, so it isn't fat-fingered.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — UX audit, tier 2 (privacy, dead-ends, copy, a11y)

- **Never show an arbitrary patient's history.** Reaching "היסטוריית פגישות" with
  no patient selected previously fell back to `patients[0]` — showing (and naming)
  someone the user never chose. It now presents a patient picker empty state.
- **Actionable dead-ends.** Search "no results" now offers a "מטופל חדש" action; the
  empty patients screen adds an "או העלו הקלטה" path to the core flow.
- **Fixed Help copy** that pointed to a non-existent home action ("יצירת דוח הכנה
  בדף הבית") → now points to the real "דוח לפגישה הבאה" path.
- **Route-aware main landmark.** `#main-content` is labelled with the current route
  title (via `ROUTE_TITLES`), so screen-reader users hear the destination on each
  navigation instead of a generic "תוכן ראשי".
- Guarded by `tests/uxTier2.test.tsx`.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — UX audit, tier 1 (highest-impact discoverability, trust & routing)

From a full end-to-end UX audit; the top-tier, lowest-risk fixes.

- **Upload/record is now a first-class destination.** Added `upload` to the
  single-source `navConfig`, so it appears in the sidebar, ⌘K palette, and quick
  nav — the core value action was previously reachable only via the app-bar CTA.
- **The app-bar "העלאת הקלטה" CTA (and the other upload entry points) route through
  `navigate()`** instead of mutating `route` directly — so the upload screen is
  deep-linkable/refresh-safe, scroll resets, `#main-content` gets focus (screen-
  reader route cue), and the title updates. Fixed in AppBar, PatientPage, the
  calendar-event dialog, and the command palette.
- **Prep report carries a clinical disclaimer.** New shared `AiDisclaimer`
  component (single source for the wording) now footers the prep report — the
  primary AI output previously had none, unlike the summary and letter.
- **First-run welcome on Home.** A dismissible tip guides new users to the core
  flow (record → AI summary → prep report) and notes local data handling; the
  dismissal persists.
- Guarded by `tests/uxTier1.test.tsx` (+ updated `navConfig` contract test).

## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — screen-improvement spec, phase 3d: scheduling extras

- **Recurring weekly meetings.** The schedule dialog has a "חזרה" option
  (חד-פעמית / שבועית · 4 / שבועית · 8); a weekly choice creates that many meetings
  a week apart in one action.
- **Add a patient with a first meeting.** The create-patient form has an opt-in
  "קביעת פגישה ראשונה לאחר היצירה" checkbox that jumps straight into the schedule
  dialog for the new patient.
- **Google Calendar connect (demo).** A "חיבור ל-Google Calendar" button on the
  home side panel shows an honest "coming soon" toast — no fake OAuth, no secrets
  (real sync is backend scope).
- Guarded by `tests/scheduleExtras.test.tsx`.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — screen-improvement spec, phase 3c: patient data model

- **Address.** Patients now carry an optional `address`, shown on the patient file
  header and editable in the create/edit form. Seeded on the demo roster.
- **Treatment span for archived files.** Archiving stamps an `archived_at`
  (treatment end date); the archived file and archive list now show
  "טיפול: MM.YYYY–MM.YYYY · N חודשים" instead of "מאז". Restoring clears it.
  New `formatTreatmentSpan` helper.
- **Seed backfill.** `reconcileMockPatients` now backfills fields added after a
  roster was first cached (e.g. address), so returning demo users see the new
  details; fixed `syncPatients` to apply a reconcile that changed fields (not just
  length). Guarded by `tests/patientFields.test.tsx`.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added — screen-improvement spec, phase 3b: calendar views

The home calendar's day/week/month toggle now actually switches views, and empty
slots are schedulable.

- **Functional day/week/month toggle.** The segmented control switches an in-place
  `calView` instead of navigating away; prev/next and the title adapt per view
  (day → single date, week → range, month → month name).
- **Day view** reuses the time grid with a single column; **month view** is a real
  month grid showing per-day appointment counts, where clicking a day with meetings
  opens that day and clicking an empty day starts a new meeting on it.
- **Click an empty slot to schedule.** Each day column has a labelled, keyboard-
  operable click target that opens the schedule dialog prefilled with the clicked
  date and (grid) time — kept as a sibling of the event buttons so it never nests
  interactive controls (axe-clean). Guarded by `tests/calendarViews.test.tsx`.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed — screen-improvement spec, phase 3a: session-detail & records

Restructures the session history around a single screen (no separate inner pages)
and moves the clinical letter into per-patient documents.

- **Session detail is now the full record.** Removed the transcript section (there
  are no call transcripts) and embedded the full AI summary inline — the "סיכום
  הפגישה" text plus **נושאים מרכזיים** and **דגלי סיכון** — so the history screen
  is self-contained rather than linking out to an inner page. Kept "תובנות
  מרכזיות" on top and an "עריכת הסיכום" link to the editable summary.
- **Full-summary page trimmed** per spec: removed the "צפייה בתמלול" button, the
  "מכתב קליני" button (moved — see below), and the single-meeting-irrelevant
  "דפוסים חוזרים" card; "נושאים מרכזיים" is now full width.
- **Clinical letter → per-patient documents.** New "מסמכים" section on the patient
  screen holds the clinical letter (with room for document uploads later).
- **Single source of truth:** the summary's main-topics + risk-flags demo content
  moved to `src/data/sessionDetail.ts` (`SESSION_MAIN_TOPICS`, `SESSION_RISK_FLAGS`),
  consumed by both the session-detail and full-summary screens.
- Tests: `patientDocuments`; updated session-detail assertions.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added / Changed — screen-improvement spec, phase 2 (no new dependencies, no backend)

Real behaviors on the home, calendar, and patient surfaces.

- **Real text-to-speech (TTS).** New `src/hooks/useTts.ts` wraps the browser's
  Web Speech API (`speechSynthesis`) — no dependency, client-only, and degrades
  gracefully (`supported` is false when the API is absent, so the control hides).
  Guarded by `tests/tts.test.ts`.
- **Home — daily "open the day" recap.** A "סיכום יומי" button in the calendar
  toolbar reads today's agenda (count, patients, times) aloud.
- **Meeting details on click.** Clicking a meeting on the week view now opens the
  meeting-details dialog instead of jumping to the Patients tab. The dialog gained
  a "מהפגישה הקודמת" recap (the patient's latest session summary) with a TTS
  play button, plus "דוח הכנה" (prep report) and "העלאת הקלטה" (upload for this
  meeting) actions. Guarded by `tests/meetingDetails.test.tsx`.
- **Archived patient file is scheduling-read-only.** An archived file hides the
  upload / schedule / prep-report actions and the archive button, shows "פגישה
  אחרונה" instead of the next-meeting chip, and offers "שחזור לרשימת הפעילים".
  Guarded by `tests/patientArchiveView.test.tsx`.
- **Edit patient details** from the patient screen header (opens the edit dialog).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added / Changed — screen-improvement spec, phase 1 (no new dependencies, no backend)

Implements the low-risk first slice of the hackathon screen-improvement spec.

- **Bespoke patient session content.** Introduced `src/data/patientSessionContent.ts`
  — a per-patient override of the generic seed arrays, keyed by patient id and
  ordered most-recent-first. Wired **Simba (p5)** to his real 5-session
  trauma-processing arc: each session's summary + the therapist's clinical note
  (surfaced as the key insight) + a session title. `sessionSummaries`,
  `sessionInsight`, `demoSessionCount`, and a new `sessionTitle` consult it; every
  other patient keeps the shared neutral content. Guarded by
  `tests/patientSessionContent.test.ts`.
- **Session detail:** renamed "תובנה" → "תובנות מרכזיות" and now shows the bespoke
  session title under the heading (`SessionDetailPage`).
- **Patient screen:** renamed "הערות קליניות" → "סיכום כללי" and moved it to the top
  of the sidebar; removed the duplicated "פרטי מטופל" card (details, incl. "מאז",
  now live in the header); added an "העברה לארכיון" button beside permanent delete.
- **Home:** merged the two identical schedule buttons into one (kept "פגישה חדשה"
  in the calendar header; removed the side-panel duplicate + its dead CSS).
- **Patient archive:** removed the redundant per-row "בארכיון" badge; added a
  name/phone/email search box with a no-results state; default alphabetical sort.

### Maintenance

- Excluded `.claude/` (Claude Code session worktrees) from eslint + vitest so
  transient repo copies can't pollute local lint/test runs.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed — correctness & accessibility (no new dependencies, no backend)

- **Unified search now returns session results.** `SearchPage` built its own
  session list with a hardcoded `n = 0`, so the loop never ran and the "פגישות"
  (sessions) category was permanently empty — search could only ever surface
  patients, despite the advertised "חיפוש מטופלים ופגישות". It now reuses the
  canonical `buildPatientSessions()` (single source of truth), removing the
  duplicated local builder. Guarded by `tests/searchSessions.test.tsx`.
- **Upload "existing transcript" modal is keyboard-accessible.** The conflict
  dialog was hand-rolled and bypassed the shared focus system: focus never moved
  into it, Tab could escape to the background, and Escape did nothing. It now uses
  `useFocusTrap`, closes on Escape, and is labelled via `aria-labelledby` /
  `aria-describedby` (WCAG 2.1.2 / 2.4.3). Covered by `tests/focusTrap.test.tsx`.
- **Drag-drop no longer uploads a phantom file.** Dropping non-file content
  (text, a link) fabricated and uploaded a fake `פגישה_22-06.mp3`. The synthetic
  sample is now gated behind `demoMode`; a real build stays idle. Guarded by
  `tests/uploadDropNoFile.test.tsx`.
- **Toasts announce with matching urgency.** Success/info toasts now use
  `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"` instead of always interrupting the
  screen reader; errors/warnings keep `role="alert"` / assertive. Guarded by
  `tests/snackbarAriaLive.test.tsx`.

### Maintenance

- Synced the `package-lock.json` version field to 1.1.0 and corrected stale
  suite counts in `CLAUDE.md` / `TESTING.md` (now 54 files / 362 tests, pre-1.1.1).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added — calendar week-view home + mobile-experience foundation (new-ui)

Implements the "SENSI — READY FOR PROD" designs, reusing the existing stack (no
new dependencies, no backend): a redesigned home and the groundwork for a
dedicated mobile experience.

- **New home — Google-Calendar-style week view.** The dashboard's stat list is
  replaced by a full week grid: 7 day columns over an 08:00–19:00 hour gutter,
  a live "now" line on today's column, colour-coded session-type event blocks, a
  mini-month, a category legend, week navigation + "today", and a "new meeting"
  CTA that opens the existing schedule dialog. Events come from the same source
  as the calendar (`loadCalendarEvents` — demo fixture now, senseiapi `/calendar`
  when configured) merged with locally-scheduled appointments, so it stays in
  sync with the rest of the app and lights up automatically with a real backend.
  Every control is a native, keyboard-operable button. Guarded by
  `tests/dashboardCalendar.test.tsx` (events render, week nav + today drive the
  range heading) and the updated a11y/routing suites.
- **Session-category colour tokens.** Added five week-view swatches
  (`--cat-*-bg/bar/text`) plus a `--now-line` indicator to `styles/tokens.css`
  in both light and dark themes; every text-on-swatch pair is AA-verified in
  `tests/contrast.test.ts`. No hardcoded hex enters components.
- **Dedicated mobile experience — shell + day view.** Below 768px the app now
  renders a touch-first shell (`MobileApp`) instead of the desktop layout: a
  compact header, the existing sidebar reused as a slide-in drawer, and the
  global Snackbar/Dialogs. The home is a **mobile day view** — a horizontal
  14-day strip with a month picker over a per-day appointment list; each
  appointment expands to quick actions (insight / attach / record) and a
  "prepare for next meeting" CTA, with insight/attach as bottom-sheets and
  confirmations via the store toast. Appointments come from the same
  `useWeekEvents` source as the desktop week view. Routes without a bespoke
  mobile screen render the shared page in a narrow wrapper. Guarded by
  `tests/mobileDayView.test.tsx`.
- **Mobile prep report, patient profile, and recording.** The mobile flow is
  complete: the day view's "prepare" CTA opens a **mobile prep report**
  (previous-session summary, follow-up points, checkable goals, AI insight —
  the same data as the desktop `ReportPage`); appointments/prep open a **mobile
  patient profile** (avatar, contact, next meeting, recent sessions); and the
  record action opens a full-screen **recording overlay** (elapsed timer,
  animated waveform, pause/resume/stop/cancel) built on the existing
  `useAudioRecorder` hook — now extended with pause/resume. Guarded by
  `tests/mobileScreens.test.tsx`.
- **`useIsMobile` viewport hook** (`src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts`) gates desktop vs
  mobile; **`useWeekEvents`** centralizes week-event loading for both shells;
  **`data/sessionCategories.ts`** and **`data/reportContent.ts`** are the single
  sources for category/prep content shared by desktop and mobile. All emoji-free
  (inline SVG icons), tokens-only, RTL-logical. Unit-tested
  (`tests/useIsMobile.test.tsx`).
- **Tooling:** eslint now ignores the gitignored design-sync artefact/tooling
  directories (`ds-bundle`, `.ds-sync`, `.design-sync`) so local lint matches CI.

### Fixed

- **Patient "upcoming meetings" no longer leak generic calendar-demo events.**
  In demo mode `loadPatientUpcomingEvents` injected the weekly calendar-view
  fixture into a specific patient's list, so same-named generic slots
  (e.g. a "דנה לוי" fixture meeting) surfaced as that patient's real upcoming
  appointments — and, worse, the set that was still "upcoming" depended on the
  current date, making the list (and `tests/patientUpcomingMeetings.test.tsx`)
  date-dependent. A patient's upcoming meetings now come only from their own
  scheduled appointments (matching API mode); the generic fixture stays where it
  belongs — the calendar view.

### Changed

- **Mobile screens use the same API paths as the desktop pages** (so they light
  up with a real backend, not demo-only):
  - `MobilePatient`'s next meeting reads the API-aware `usePatientUpcomingMeetings`
    hook (was client-only `scheduledAppts`), matching `PatientPage`.
  - `MobilePrepReport` now shows the **live next-meeting report** (polled from
    senseiapi via the new shared `useNextMeetingReport` hook) when configured,
    falling back to the shared demo copy — parity with the desktop `ReportPage`.
  - `MobileRecording` hands the captured file to `submitUpload`
    (senseiapi `/audio/upload`) when configured, attaching the appointment's
    calendar meeting id (threaded from the day view) as `meetingId` — the same
    contract `UploadPage` requires; a record action with no linked meeting, or
    demo mode, stays a toast-only confirmation.
  - Calendar data on both new shells already flowed through `loadCalendarEvents`
    (fixture now, API when configured).

- **Prep report (`ReportPage` + mobile) realigned to the agreed structure**:
  patient card now carries a "מעבר לתיק מטופל" quick action + a labelled phone;
  sections are סקירה מהירה → תקציר קולי → **סיכום הפגישה הקודמת** → **נקודות
  למעקב** → **מטרות לפגישה הקרובה** → **שאלות מוצעות למפגש**. The live-report
  fields map onto the new labels (intro / last_summary_excerpt / changes /
  open_topics); suggested questions are demo-only (`REPORT_QUESTIONS`), hidden
  once a live backend report is shown. The mobile prep report gained a "סקירה
  מהירה" card and the questions section, dropping the redundant insight card.

## [1.0.80] — 2026-07-06

### Added — clinical-notes draft recovery (parity with the summary editor)

- Extends the work-recovery protection from 1.0.77 to the product's other clinical editor: a
  therapist editing a patient's **clinical notes** who is interrupted — a notification, the command
  palette, any navigation — no longer loses the text. `navigate()` reset `editingNotes` on every
  route change and the in-progress note wasn't persisted, so it vanished silently (the same gap the
  summary editor had). In-progress notes are now auto-captured per patient (`S.notesDrafts[id]`,
  persisted); on return a calm recovery banner ("יש טיוטה שלא נשמרה · להמשיך?") offers **המשך עריכה**
  or **מחיקת הטיוטה**. Cleared on save/cancel/discard; an empty draft never triggers it. The pattern
  and copy mirror the summary editor exactly, so the two clinical editors now behave identically.
- Verified live end-to-end (type note → navigate away → return → banner → resume → save → draft
  cleared, note persisted) and on mobile 375px (banner wraps, zero overflow). Guarded by
  `tests/notesDraftRecovery.test.tsx` (capture, survive-interruption, resume, discard, no-phantom-
  after-cancel).
- This was the #1 item from the prior review's recommendation report — highest value, lowest
  complexity, extends an existing pattern, zero new dependencies. Suite: 52 files, 388 tests.

## [1.0.79] — 2026-07-06

### Changed — design-system consistency: elevation is now single-sourced (SSOT)

- `CARD_SHADOW` (the standard card elevation) already existed as a canonical constant in
  `utils/styles.ts` and was correctly imported by 8 files — but the exact same shadow literal was
  **inlined 31 times across 12 other page files**. Change the elevation once and 31 places would
  drift. All 31 now use the `CARD_SHADOW` constant (imports added where missing). Zero visual change
  (identical value — live-verified the computed box-shadow is byte-for-byte the same); pure
  design-system-consistency / single-source-of-truth win. No behavioral change.
- This is the "review and fix design-system consistency" portion of the request. The feature-idea
  portion is delivered as an advisory recommendation report (not built) — the standing guardrail is
  no speculative features / no bloat; recommendations are prioritized by impact vs complexity.
- Suite: 51 files, 384 tests (unchanged — a pure refactor guarded by the existing route-render and
  canonical suites).

## [1.0.78] — 2026-07-06

### Changed — consolidated duplicated task-priority mapping (SSOT); bug audit found forms robust

- **Duplication removed:** the task-priority label/color mapping (דחוף/בינוני/נמוך → tokens) was
  defined twice — a function in `TasksPage` and an object with different key names (`l/c/b`) in
  `SearchPage` — a genuine single-source-of-truth violation. Both now call one canonical
  `priorityMeta()` in `src/utils` (mirroring `riskMeta`), SSOT-mapped in ARCHITECTURE.md. No visual
  or behavioral change; verified live that all task-priority chips render identically on both the
  Tasks screen and in global search.
- **Bug audit — the forms and interactions came back robust, verified not assumed:** the search
  highlighter uses `indexOf`, not `RegExp`, so regex-special input (`(([*`) can't crash it
  (live-confirmed); the age field sanitizes to digits-only (`replace(/\D/g,'')`, max 3) at the
  input layer, so decimals/letters/overflow are impossible before validation even runs; name
  validation rejects whitespace-only; no `new RegExp` is ever built from user input anywhere in the
  codebase. No functional defects found in this pass.
- Suite: 51 files, 384 tests (new: `priorityMeta` unit coverage incl. the unknown→low fallback).

## [1.0.77] — 2026-07-06

### Added — clinical summary draft recovery (never lose in-progress work)

- **The gap:** a therapist editing an AI session summary who was interrupted — a notification, the
  command palette, any navigation — lost their edit silently. `editingSummary`/`summaryDraft` were
  transient and `navigate()` explicitly resets `editingSummary:false` on every route change, so the
  in-progress clinical wording vanished with no warning and no recovery. This is the highest-stakes
  work-loss path in the product and it directly violated the "never lose unsaved work" principle.
- **The fix (calm, not intrusive):** in-progress edits are now auto-captured per patient
  (`S.summaryDrafts[id]`, persisted). An interruption no longer loses anything — on return, a quiet
  recovery banner ("יש טיוטה שלא נשמרה מעריכה קודמת · להמשיך?") offers **המשך עריכה** or
  **מחיקת הטיוטה**. No blocking dialog, no forced modal — the therapist stays in control. The draft
  is cleared on save, on cancel, or on explicit discard; an empty draft never triggers the banner.
- Verified live end-to-end (type → navigate away → return → banner → resume → save → draft cleared,
  edit persisted) and on mobile 375px (banner wraps, zero overflow). Guarded by
  `tests/summaryDraftRecovery.test.tsx` (capture, survive-interruption, resume, discard, and the
  no-phantom-after-cancel case).
- Broader UX-completeness review, reported honestly: onboarding skip (persisted dismissal) + resume
  (progress derived from real actions, 1.0.73), preference persistence (theme, accessibility,
  notifications, Moment), and responsive layouts (375/768/1366) were verified already-solid in
  prior passes; the summary editor was the one genuine work-recovery gap. Suite: 51 files, 383 tests.

## [1.0.76] — 2026-07-06

### Improved — analytics charts are now legible to screen readers (a11y)

- Audit finding, evidence-based: the accessibility tree showed the three analytics charts
  (פגישות לאורך זמן, התפלגות רמות סיכון, נושאים נפוצים) exposing a loose run of numbers with no
  framing — a screen-reader user navigating by heading heard bare digits, not a chart. Each chart
  is now a `role="img"` with a data-derived Hebrew `aria-label` summarizing it in one sentence
  (e.g. "מספר פגישות מעובדות לפי שבוע, במגמת עלייה: 22, 28, …"), so assistive tech gets a coherent
  announcement. The risk summary tracks the live patient mix (not a hardcoded string).
- Decorative KPI icons on the analytics page are now `aria-hidden` — they no longer surface as
  meaningless unnamed "graphic" nodes. **Zero purely-visual change**: bars, cards, colors and
  layout render identically (screenshot-verified); the blue-only palette, RTL, and design system
  are untouched.
- Scope kept honest and proportionate: this fixes the charts actually audited. A wider gap remains
  — ~169 decorative inline SVGs across the app lack `aria-hidden` — but a blind sweep is unsafe
  (some icons are the sole accessible name of icon-only buttons; hiding those would strip the
  name), so that's flagged for a dedicated shared-Icon-component pass, not a risky mass edit.
- Suite: 50 files, 379 tests (new: `tests/analyticsChartsA11y.test.tsx` — chart summaries present,
  data-bearing, and in sync with the seeded mix). Live-verified on the running build.

## [1.0.75] — 2026-07-06

### Improved — Tasks screen management flows (verified pass + four real gaps closed)

- Audit verdict first: sorting (overdue→today→upcoming, priority within), counted filters,
  undo-able delete, accessible checkbox rows, the composer, and responsive wrapping were already
  solid. Four genuine gaps fixed:
  - **Inline rename** — a pencil on every open task edits the text in place (Enter/blur saves,
    Escape cancels without bubbling to the global cascade). Renaming no longer means
    delete-and-recreate.
  - **Composer feedback** — adding with an empty description used to be a silent no-op; it now
    gives gentle guidance ("הזינו תיאור משימה") and returns focus to the field.
  - **Accessible filter state** — the filter chips are explicit buttons (role, tabIndex, keyboard
    activation) with `aria-pressed`, so assistive tech hears which view is active. Caught and
    shaped by the axe suite: `aria-pressed` on a bare link was invalid; explicit semantics beat
    relying on the runtime promotion engine.
  - **Contextual empty states** — the single "כל הכבוד, אין משימות פתוחות" message was wrong for
    the done filter (nothing completed ≠ praise) and unhelpful for new users. Now: first-run
    points at the composer, an empty done filter explains what will appear, and an empty
    filtered view offers one-click "הצגת כל המשימות".
- Suite: 49 files, 377 tests (7 new: rename save/cancel, composer guidance, aria-pressed,
  all three empty-state variants).

## [1.0.74] — 2026-07-06

### Added — "רגע בשבילי" v2: the curated wellbeing library (therapist-feedback P2)

- The between-session pause now opens on a **quiet chooser of four curated activities** (small on
  purpose — calm over choice overload): נשימה שקטה (30 שניות / דקה / 3 דקות, persisted preference),
  תרגיל קרקוע 5-4-3-2-1 (staged sense prompts, aria-live), הרהור שקט (original Japanese-inspired
  reflections rotating daily + silent countdown), and מתיחה ומים (gentle body reminder). Last-used
  activity is remembered. Every screen keeps the binding constraints: early finish, backdrop, and
  the Escape cascade always exit; no gamification, no pressure, no patient data anywhere in the
  experience (test-asserted).
- **Three levels of control on the suggestion card**, per the feedback spec: התחלת הפסקה ·
  מאוחר יותר (snoozes this visit only — deliberately NOT persisted) · hide (persisted, reversible
  in Settings → notifications, whose copy now reflects the library).
- Honest scope decisions, documented rather than faked: trigger detection stays deterministic and
  user-controlled — simulating "AI emotional-intensity" signals without a real model would be
  feature theater; ambient/nature sounds need audio assets that don't exist; analytics
  infrastructure doesn't exist in this client-only build (nothing to instrument). The
  handwritten-notes OCR future capability got its integration points documented in
  ARCHITECTURE.md (upload surface → services seam → notes destination) — extension without
  restructuring, exactly as the feedback requires.
- Suite: 48 files, 370 tests (v2 arcs: chooser, durations, grounding steps, snooze-vs-dismiss
  semantics, privacy assertion). Browser-visual spot-check deferred this turn — the session's
  preview-server slots were exhausted by parallel chats; behavior is fully covered in jsdom and
  the card reuses the wrap layout verified at 375px in 1.0.68.

## [1.0.73] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed — onboarding now acknowledges the user's first success (E2E UX + bug audit pass)

- **The getting-started checklist was lying.** Steps 3 ("העלאת הקלטה") and 4 ("אישור סיכום AI")
  were hardcoded "not done": a user who followed the checklist and completed both actions stayed at
  "2 מתוך 4 הושלמו" forever — a broken feedback loop at the exact moment of first success, the
  highest-impact finding of the jobs-to-be-done review. Steps 3–4 are now DERIVED from real state:
  a completed upload records a persisted `hasUploaded` milestone, and step 4 reads the existing
  `summaryApproved` map. Progress and the completion bar update the moment each job is done.
- TDD (proven red first) in `tests/onboardingProgress.test.tsx`: approval → "3 מתוך 4", both →
  "4 מתוך 4", and a real simulated upload sets the persisted flag. Verified live end-to-end as a
  user: upload → dashboard shows 3/4 → approve the AI summary → 4/4.
- The rest of the bundle re-verified against existing coverage, honestly: responsiveness swept at
  375/768/1366 (1.0.70), navigation/IA + flows behavior-tested (routing, palette, pager, dialogs,
  merge, auth), copy/a11y/cognitive-load audits at saturation (1.0.72), bug sweep = full suite +
  live console census clean. Suite: 48 files, 367 tests.

## [1.0.72] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed — UX/UI/copy/a11y optimization pass (post-blue-remap color-independence audit)

- The pass's new angle: after 1.0.69 collapsed four semantic hues into blue depths, every UI spot
  that differentiated states was re-audited for **color-independence**. Verified carrying non-color
  signals already: task priorities (labeled chips דחוף/בינוני/נמוך), outcome trends (directional
  arrows + magnitude), analytics deltas (+/− signs), risk levels (Hebrew labels), overdue dates
  (weight + the date text itself). One real gap found and fixed:
- **Unread messages were a colored dot alone** — silent to screen readers (WCAG 1.4.1 / 4.1.2) and
  typographically identical to read rows. The indicator now carries an accessible label ("הודעה
  שלא נקראה") and unread previews render heavier (600) in stronger text color; opening the
  conversation clears both. Guarded by `tests/messagesUnread.test.tsx` and verified live.
- **Friction walkthroughs** (live): add-task is type + one click with the composer clearing itself;
  messages open-and-mark-read is one click; core flows (upload cancel/retry, auth journeys, summary
  approve, merge) are covered by their dedicated suites. Copy, contrast, keyboard operability,
  touch targets, focus states and empty/error/loading states were each verified by the dedicated
  audits of 1.0.62–1.0.71 and their CI guards — re-run green here (47 files, 364 tests); no further
  defects found. Saturation declared honestly rather than churning stable surfaces.

## [1.0.71] — 2026-07-06

### Added — Hebrew-native regression guards + one real leak fixed (pre-launch gate pass)

- **New guard suite `tests/hebrewNative.test.tsx` (29 tests, TDD red→green):** pins `lang="he"` +
  `dir="rtl"` on the document, and renders every route (23) plus all five auth screens asserting
  **no unintended Latin text** — any English string outside a reviewed allowlist (clinical
  acronyms/instruments like PHQ-9/EDE-Q/Y-BOCS, brand terms, keyboard keys in `<kbd>`, technical
  strings like emails/IDs) fails CI. This is the missing localization regression net: an
  untranslated "Submit" anywhere now breaks the build.
- **The census found exactly one real leak** in the whole application: the referral letter's footer
  said "AI-assisted" — now "בסיוע AI". Everything else Latin on screen is sanctioned terminology.
- **Pre-launch gate re-verified:** build/typecheck/lint/tests green (46 files / 363 tests, incl.
  both-theme contrast, axe, RTL/copy guards, auth flows, stale-chunk recovery); zero console errors
  across all 23 routes measured with an in-page error hook on a clean session (earlier buffered
  errors were HMR artifacts from the edit session itself, proven stale by module timestamps); no
  placeholder/demo-leak content (demo data is the product's labeled purpose); routes/deep links,
  responsive 375/768/1366 and touch targets verified in the preceding releases. Frontend release
  decision: READY FOR PRODUCTION (as a client-only demo/design reference — its stated scope).

## [1.0.70] — 2026-07-06

### Added / Fixed — cross-device audit, dedup pass, stale-deploy recovery

- **Stale-client recovery (deploy safety).** The caching architecture was already correct (HTML
  `max-age=0, must-revalidate`; hashed `/assets/*` immutable — vercel.json + `_headers`; no service
  worker exists, so no SW lifecycle risk). The remaining gap: after a deploy, an old client opening
  a lazy route hit a dead chunk hash and got the generic error card whose "back home" button can't
  help. The ErrorBoundary now detects dynamic-import failures and shows "גרסה חדשה של סנסיי זמינה"
  with a reload action — loop-safe (fresh HTML always brings current hashes) and session-safe
  (state persists in localStorage). Test-guarded.
- **Code dedup (canonicalization pass on 1.0.64–1.0.66 additions):** one canonical `EMAIL_RE` in
  `src/utils` replaces three divergent patterns (two lenient, one strict — validation is now
  uniformly strict across login/registration/reset/profile), and one shared `ErrorAlert` replaces
  four identical banner blocks in the auth screens. Data layer (DRY RUN, no execution): the only
  duplicate cluster in seed data — patients p2/p9 (יוסי/יוסף מזרחי) — is the *intentional* fixture
  that demonstrates the product's own dedup/merge feature (DedupPage + merge flow implement
  canonical selection, conflict review and traceability); merging it in seed would delete the
  feature's demo. Flagged as by-design, not executed.
- **Cross-device sweep:** all 23 routes instrumented at 375, 768 and 1366px — zero clipped or
  out-of-viewport elements outside scroll containers at any width. Touch-target census on the new
  surfaces found one real miss: the "רגע בשבילי" dismiss X (19px svg) is now a proper 28px button
  (real button semantics + comfortable target); pre-existing 22px close affordances are the
  documented inline exceptions from the earlier WCAG 2.5.8 audit. Suite: 45 files, 334 tests.

## [1.0.69] — 2026-07-06

### Changed — unified blue-only visual identity (semantic states remapped to a blue depth ladder)

- Per explicit design directive, blue and its shades are now the product's ONLY visual language:
  the semantic state families (`--error/--warning/--success/--info` + their bg/border/surface
  variants) are remapped in `styles/tokens.css` — both themes — from red/amber/green to a **blue
  severity ladder**. Light theme: severity = depth (error `#123A85` deepest → warning `#24549E` →
  success `#2F66B0`); dark theme: severity = lightness (error `#A9C7F7` lightest/most prominent).
  Because 1.0.67 forced every color through the tokens, this single-file remap restyles every
  button, chip, badge, toast, banner, chart, meter and state across all 23 routes at once — and is
  just as trivially reversible.
- **Meaning is never color-alone** (and never was): risk chips carry Hebrew labels, error banners
  carry icons + a "שגיאה" badge, toasts carry per-type icons, the strength meter carries text, KPI
  cards carry labels — the blue remap changes hue, not comprehension. All remapped text-on-tint
  pairs were computed at 5.0–13.5:1 (light) and 6.4–9.5:1 (dark) before committing, and the
  empirical WCAG contrast suite passes against the new values in both themes.
- Two indigo-leaning shadow literals (`rgba(62,67,194)` AI-FAB glow, `rgba(35,38,111)` banner
  shadow) aligned to the standard primary/navy shadow values; an rgba census confirms every
  remaining alpha literal is navy/blue/white/black. Known limit, noted honestly: the mascot logo
  is a raster illustration with violet tones — recoloring brand artwork is an asset decision, not
  a code change. Suite: 45 files, 333 tests.

## [1.0.68] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed — final polish pass (instrumented sweep, all routes, 375px→desktop)

- A product-polish sweep instrumented every route for horizontal overflow, clipped elements and
  layout distortion at mobile and mid widths, in both themes, with a focused walkthrough of the
  surfaces added in 1.0.64–1.0.67. Three real defects found and fixed, all mobile-width:
  - **"רגע בשבילי" card crushed its own copy on phones** — the fixed-width CTA squeezed the text
    column to 22px (one word per line; a 262px-tall card). The card now wraps and below 560px the
    CTA takes its own full-width row: 141px tall with a 196px text column (measured live).
  - **Upload processing row distorted its icon** — the 48px icon box lacked `flex-shrink: 0` and
    compressed to 28px next to long filenames; filenames now also truncate with an ellipsis
    (`dir="ltr"`, logical alignment) instead of squeezing their neighbors.
  - **Signup said "לפחות 8 תווים" twice** (placeholder + strength-meter caption) while the password
    field was empty — the caption now appears only once typing starts.
- Verified clean, honestly reported: zero horizontal overflow across all 23 routes at 375px; the
  documents/reports document-level scrollWidth readings at mid widths are invisible artifacts —
  `html,body{overflow-x:hidden}` clips them, page panning is impossible, and the data tables scroll
  fully inside their own containers (measured reachable). No placeholder/lorem/debug copy anywhere
  (scanned). Suite: 45 files, 333 tests.

## [1.0.67] — 2026-07-06

### Changed — global design-system color standardization (hex ratchet 66 → 8)

- Every color in the application now comes from the design system. The frozen debt of 66 hardcoded
  hex literals is paid down to exactly 8 — the `AVATAR_PALETTE` scale in `src/utils/index.ts`, the
  only sanctioned raw hex outside `styles/tokens.css` (avatarColors() derives tint backgrounds and
  dark-mode initials arithmetically, which CSS variables can't feed). The canonical ratchet guard
  now scans `.ts` as well as `.tsx` and its baseline is **8, non-increasing**.
- **Constant whites → `var(--on-accent)`** (35 sites): icon fills and text on colored/gradient
  surfaces, white tiles (logo, AI mascot), the print stylesheet, selected-day calendar text.
  Identical rendering in both themes — the token stays white by design.
- **Status hexes → semantic tokens**: `#9A6200/#8F2A24/#2E6B35` (exact token values) now reference
  `--warning/--error-dark/--success`; `#F3F7FD/#0A1426` eliminated by reading the computed `--bg`
  token for the browser-chrome `theme-color` meta (verified live: light `#F3F7FD`, dark `#0A1426`,
  both resolved from the token, not literals).
- **Avatar palette consolidated**: the same 8 system blues previously duplicated across seed data,
  the create-patient dialog, the getPatient fallback and the profile picker now come from one
  canonical `AVATAR_PALETTE` (SSOT-mapped in ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Off-system colors removed**: the profile avatar picker offered green/amber/red/purple identity
  swatches — green/amber/red collide with the semantic status language (a red avatar reads as an
  alert) and purple is outside the palette entirely. The picker now offers six system blues with
  Hebrew names; a previously-saved off-scale choice still renders (graceful), it just is no longer
  offered. This is the release's only user-visible change.
- Honestly N/A in this client-only build: email templates, PDF exports, maps/editors/audio-player
  libraries (none exist — the UI is dependency-free), and chart libraries (charts are hand-rolled
  and already token-driven). Verified: full suite green including both-theme contrast tests and
  axe; live checks of light + dark meta theme-color, per-patient avatar hues in dark mode, and the
  new picker. Suite: 45 files, 333 tests.

## [1.0.66] — 2026-07-06

### Added — "רגע בשבילי" (Moment for Me) v1 + real report exports

- **Moment for Me v1** (`src/components/MomentForMe.tsx`) — the P0 wellbeing feature from the Mativ
  therapist-feedback guidelines: a quiet, dismissible suggestion card on the dashboard offering a
  one-minute breathing exercise between sessions. Binding design constraints implemented exactly:
  always optional (one-click dismiss, persisted), fully removable (Settings → התראות toggle;
  re-enabling clears a previous dismissal), never trapping (early-finish button, backdrop click, and
  the global Escape cascade all close it), accessible (dialog semantics, `aria-live="polite"` phase
  cues שאיפה/נשיפה so the exercise works without the animation, reduced-motion respected by the
  existing global rules), and calm by design (design-token visuals, no noise, no judgment).
- **Reports download is now real.** The reports list's הורדה action previously showed a toast
  claiming a PDF was downloaded — with no file (download theater). It now produces a real UTF-8
  text file, honestly labeled as demo output. The Blob path is consolidated into the canonical
  `src/utils/download.ts` (shared with the transcript export).
- **Mativ guidelines audit (copy, trust, positioning):** product voice verified on-brand — the
  tagline "ניהול שקט למטפלים" and error copy already follow the empowerment framing ("shows last
  data", recovery-first); the problem-framing sweep found hits only in *clinical* content about
  patients, which is correct terminology, not product messaging. Trust visibility confirmed:
  dedicated privacy settings tab, privacy FAQ in Help, the upload-time privacy panel, and the auth
  footer keep security one tap away. No copy changes were needed.
- Sharing/import/export/sync protocol reviewed against the client-only scope: sharing (sanitized
  WhatsApp/Email menu), sync status + offline awareness, notification preferences, and the audit-log
  table already exist and are test-covered; transcript + report exports are now real. Bulk
  operations, versioning UI, templates, automation, external APIs/webhooks, two-way sync, and
  compliance tooling are backend-era scope — documented, not faked. Suite: 45 files, 333 tests.

## [1.0.65] — 2026-07-06

### Improved — Recordings & Transcriptions module (verified pass + four real gaps closed)

- Module audit (UploadPage + TranscriptPage): the upload state machine
  (idle/dragging/uploading/success/error + retry), staged pipeline, format validation, privacy
  panel, transcript speaker labels/timestamps/search/highlight/copy and loading skeletons all
  verified working — most requirements were already met. Four genuine gaps closed:
  - **Upload can now be cancelled mid-processing** — a ביטול button stops the simulated pipeline
    and returns to the drop zone (previously the user was locked in until completion).
  - **Accessible progress**: the progress bar is a real `role="progressbar"`
    (`aria-valuenow/min/max`), the stage caption is `aria-live="polite"`, success is `role="status"`
    and failure `role="alert"` — screen readers now follow the whole pipeline.
  - **Transcript empty-search state**: a zero-match query shows an explicit "אין תוצאות" state
    (`role="status"`) with a one-click ניקוי החיפוש escape hatch instead of a silently blank card.
  - **Transcript download**: a הורדה button exports the transcript as a UTF-8 `.txt`
    (speaker + timestamp per line) via a local Blob — copy already existed; export now does too.
- Honestly out of scope (would be backend/feature theater in a client-only demo): live microphone
  recording, audio playback and transcript-audio sync (no audio files exist), transcript editing
  (summaries are the editable artifact by design), and external sharing. Suite: 43 files, 327 tests.

## [1.0.64] — 2026-07-06

### Added — a complete frontend-only mock authentication experience

- **New canonical auth seam: `src/services/mockAuth.ts`.** All authentication logic (users,
  credentials, sessions) lives behind one frontend-only service — the swap seam for a real backend:
  screens and store consume only its interface and never touch storage directly. Users persist in
  `localStorage` (`sensei_mock_users_v1`); passwords are **never stored in plaintext** (mock-grade
  one-way hash, documented as obfuscation, not cryptography); no network is ever touched.
- **Credential login is now real (mock).** The login form validates against the stored users instead
  of accepting anything: unknown account and wrong password each get their own announced Hebrew
  error. The shipped demo credentials (`rotem@clinic.co.il` / `demo1234`, prefilled as before) are
  seeded as a virtual account, so the existing happy path is unchanged.
- **Registration actually registers.** Full name / email / password / confirm + terms consent, a
  live 3-segment password-strength meter (`aria-live="polite"`), duplicate-email detection, and a
  loading submit state. The created account persists across refreshes and can log in later; the
  signed-in identity flows into the profile (sidebar, app bar, settings).
- **Simulated Google sign-in.** A design-system button on the login screen with loading, success,
  and cancel (click-again) states; reuses one stable mock Google identity. No real OAuth.
- **Forgot → reset → done.** The reset flow now completes: request link (never disclosing whether
  the account exists) → sent confirmation with an explicit "demo, no email actually sent" note and
  a direct continue → new-password + confirm form → success. The password change is real — the old
  one stops working.
- **Remember Me is wired.** Checked (default): the session survives browser restarts. Unchecked:
  the session is scoped to the browser session; on the next launch the app lands on the existing
  "session expired" screen instead of the dashboard. Demo mode creates **no** session record and is
  preserved byte-identical — same instant entry, same toast, same seeded data.
- Logout clears the auth session record along with the existing teardown. Deep links still cannot
  bypass the auth gate (route-only, never view).
- Suite: 43 files, 324 tests (+23: service unit tests incl. a no-plaintext-in-storage assertion, and
  UI flow tests for rejection/acceptance/registration/Google/reset/remember-me — the remember-me
  enforcement proven red without the store guard). Verified live on the served build: wrong-password
  rejection, credential login (session record written), logout (record cleared), Google sign-in,
  and a full registration with zero plaintext leakage in storage.

## [1.0.63] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed — the calendar no longer fires a guaranteed-404 request on every visit

- A nine-module verification sweep found exactly one network defect: `CalendarPage` requested
  `/api/integrations/google-calendar/events` on **every calendar load and refresh** before falling
  back to its integration fixture. In the client-only build that endpoint provably doesn't exist, so
  each visit produced a 404 (console noise + a wasted round trip) — and the raw `fetch` bypassed the
  binding convention that **all backend access goes through `src/services/`**.
- Fix: the "is there a backend?" decision now belongs to the canonical client — `isApiConfigured()`.
  Unconfigured (today): the fixture renders directly, **zero network requests**. Configured
  (`VITE_API_BASE_URL` set): the live fetch targets `API_BASE_URL + endpoint` with the fixture kept
  as the graceful failure fallback. Identical UX and state machine (loading/ready/empty/error,
  refresh, abort) in both modes.
- Verified live on the production build: calendar + refresh with **0 failed requests, 0 console
  errors**, fixture events rendering. Guarded by `tests/calendarNoFetch.test.tsx` (proven red
  without the fix). The same sweep confirmed all 11 module routes render with **zero keyboard-dead
  interactive elements** — the 1.0.62 promotion fix covers every module. Suite: 41 files, 301 tests.

## [1.0.62] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed — click-only cards are keyboard-operable again (WCAG 2.1.1), app-wide

- A focused home-page (dashboard) audit found the KPI stat cards, "latest summaries" cards, and
  risk-alert rows were **mouse-only**: focusing them was impossible and Enter did nothing. Root
  cause was a subtle collision between two individually-correct accessibility features. The runtime
  engine that promotes `cursor:pointer` elements to `role="button" tabindex="0"` skips anything
  inside another interactive element (a correct WCAG 4.1.2 "nested interactive" guard) — but its
  selector counted **any** `[tabindex]`, including the `#main-content[tabindex="-1"]` route-focus
  landmark that every screen's content sits inside. So `closest(INTERACTIVE)` always matched, and
  **no click-only card anywhere in the app was ever promoted**. The axe suite couldn't see it (bare
  clickable `<div>`s aren't recognised as controls).
- Fix: exclude `tabindex="-1"` from the interactive-ancestor selector — it's a *programmatic* focus
  target, not a keyboard-reachable control, so it must not block promotion. One-line, additive: it
  only enables intended promotion; mouse behaviour is identical, and rows that genuinely nest a
  control (the schedule row's upload button) correctly stay un-promoted.
- Verified live on the production build: stat/summary/risk cards now `role="button"`, focusable, and
  Enter activates them (a risk row → the patient file); the appointment row stays plain. Guarded by a
  behavioural test in `tests/a11y.test.tsx` (proven red without the fix). Suite: 40 files, 300 tests.

## [1.0.61] — 2026-07-06

### Added — deep-linkable URL-hash routing (deep linking · bookmarking · browser history · testability)

- The app was purely state-driven: every screen lived at the same URL, so a screen could not
  be bookmarked, shared, reopened after refresh, reached by the browser back button, or
  navigated to directly by Playwright/manual testers. Added a **hash-based** route layer
  (`src/nav/urlHash.ts`) that keeps the store's `route` (+ `patientId` for patient screens)
  in sync with `location.hash` — e.g. `#/analytics`, `#/patient/p3`. Chosen over path routing
  because this is a client-only SPA on static hosting: the fragment delivers all five benefits
  with **zero server-rewrite config and no router dependency**.
- **Boundaries held deliberately** (per the decision framework — a route must earn its URL):
  auth screens, dialogs, overlays, command palette, and per-artifact sub-tabs stay
  state-driven — transient UI gains nothing from a URL. A deep link sets the **route only,
  never the view**, so a URL can never bypass the sign-in gate.
- **Defensive by construction:** an unknown route, a malformed/oversized patient id, or any
  hand-edited fragment is rejected and normalized to a safe screen — it can neither crash the
  app nor inject state. Guarded by `tests/urlHash.test.ts` (round-trip of all 23 routes,
  patient-id handling, injection/format rejection) and a canonical single-source-of-truth entry.
- No screen, flow, style, or business logic changed — this is pure addressability over the
  existing screens. Suite: 40 files, 299 tests.

## [1.0.60] — 2026-07-05

### Added — WhatsApp & Email sharing, wired into the two flows where it already belonged

Sharing was integrated **into existing flows only** — no standalone "share" page, no new business
logic, permissions or data models, and no duplicate buttons. Two surfaces gained it, each where a
share affordance was already implied:

- **Clinical letter** (`LetterPage`): a "שיתוף" menu button joins the existing Copy/Print action row.
  The letter is a document meant to be transmitted, so sharing fits — but because it carries patient
  details, the menu opens with a **sensitive-content warning** ("שתפו רק עם נמען מורשה ובערוץ מאובטח")
  before either channel.
- **Resources** (`ResourcesPage`): the placeholder "שיתוף למטופל" button (which only toasted a stub)
  now performs a real share of the generic, non-PHI resource title + description. No new button was
  added — the dead `onAssign`/`toast` stub was removed.

New reusable, framework-free utilities in `src/utils/share.ts` — `buildWhatsAppUrl` (`https://wa.me/?text=`),
`buildMailtoUrl` (mailto; recipient intentionally **never** auto-filled — no PII), `sanitizeShareText`
(strips control characters, normalizes newlines, preserves Hebrew/English/mixed text), and `canShare`.
A single accessible `ShareMenu` component (`src/components/shared/ShareMenu.tsx`) consumes them: full ARIA
menu-button pattern — the trigger opens on click/Enter/Space/ArrowDown; the open menu roves focus with
ArrowUp/ArrowDown (wrapping) and Home/End; Escape or Tab closes; outside-click closes; focus moves to the
first option on open and returns to the trigger on Escape; disabled when there is nothing to share; WhatsApp
opened via `window.open(..., 'noopener')` (no tabnabbing). Covered by `tests/share.test.ts` (URL building,
encoding, no-PII, sanitization) and
`tests/shareMenu.test.tsx` (menu UX, a11y, safe WhatsApp open). No secrets, tokens, internal IDs, or
system metadata are ever placed in a share payload.

Docs updated in step (README architecture map, ARCHITECTURE single-source-of-truth table, TESTING suite map
+ counts, CONTENT_GUIDE share-affordance microcopy + messaging-scope note). Lint 0, typecheck 0, **37 files /
265 tests** (3 consecutive green runs), logic-layer coverage ~94% lines / ~84% branches, production build clean,
no regression.

## [1.0.59] — 2026-07-05

### Changed — prep report links onward to the timeline (jobs-to-be-done efficiency)

A jobs-to-be-done review found the product well-aligned overall — the Dashboard surfaces *prioritized,
context-aware* next actions ("prep for session with {next patient}", "review {n} pending summaries",
"high-risk: {name}" → patients pre-filtered), the patient page hubs the per-patient jobs, and upload
pre-selects the patient. The one friction point: the **prep report** (`ReportPage`, the "prepare for the
next session" job) was the only patient sub-page with no onward link — to review the patient's history the
therapist had to hop back through the patient page.

- Added a **"ציר הזמן המלא ›"** (full timeline) link to the report header — one click from prep to the
  patient's complete session history, the natural next step when preparing. Uses the same link pattern the
  patient page and sibling sub-pages already use; fixes the cross-navigation asymmetry (Summary/Transcript/
  Letter already cross-link). Verified live: the link renders and navigates to the timeline.
- Guarded by `tests/reportNav.test.tsx`. Lint 0, typecheck 0, **35 files / 244 tests**, build clean.

---

## [1.0.58] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed — the closed mobile nav drawer no longer traps keyboard focus off-screen (WCAG 2.4.3)

- An interface-wide visual/layout review (overflow, clipping, alignment, responsiveness sweep across
  routes at mobile + desktop) came back clean except for one real defect in the **off-canvas mobile
  navigation drawer**. Below 860px the sidebar slides off-screen via `transform: translateX(105%)` when
  closed — but transform alone leaves the element fully in the tab order and the accessibility tree.
  Measured at 375px with the drawer closed: **14 nav links still keyboard-focusable**, sidebar neither
  `inert` nor `aria-hidden`. So a keyboard user tabs into invisible off-screen controls (focus
  disappears), a screen reader announces the entire hidden menu, and focusing an off-screen link can
  shove the viewport sideways (a transient horizontal-scroll/layout-instability I reproduced).
- Applied the standard accessible off-canvas pattern: the closed drawer is now `visibility: hidden`
  (which removes it from both the tab order and the accessibility tree), restored to `visibility:
  visible` on `.open`. A `transition: …, visibility 0s linear .26s` delay keeps it visible through the
  slide-out animation, then hides it; opening reveals it immediately. Scoped inside the
  `@media (max-width:860px)` block, so the desktop sidebar rail stays fully visible and interactive.
- Verified live at 375px: closed → `visibility:hidden`, links unfocusable; open (via the toggle) →
  fully visible, all links focusable, drawer renders correctly. No page-overflow or clipping defects
  were found on any other route. Guarded in `tests/canonical.test.ts`.

## [1.0.57] — 2026-07-05

### Changed — CI automation is more predictable & monitorable

A review of the project's automations (CI, guards, scripts) found them largely sound — but the CI workflow
lacked run-concurrency control, and its monitoring story wasn't documented.

- **Predictable runs.** Added a `concurrency` group to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: a new push supersedes
  older in-progress runs on the same PR/branch (so the newest run is always the authoritative status and CI
  minutes aren't spent on stale commits) — but `main` is **never** cancelled, so every landed commit gets a
  full gate.
- **Monitoring documented.** README now explains how to watch CI (the Actions tab / per-PR checks) and
  provides a ready-to-add status badge (to drop in once the repo is on GitHub), plus a pointer to the
  CONTRIBUTING enforcement table where every guard's threshold and **config location** is listed.

Review notes (verified, no change needed): the duplication guard genuinely **fails** over threshold
(`jscpd --threshold 1` → exit 1); thresholds are externalized in named config files (`.jscpd.json`,
`vite.config.ts`) not hard-coded in the pipeline; and the guards are documented and deterministic. No
product/runtime change; app gate green (242 tests, build clean).

---

## [1.0.56] — 2026-07-05

### Added — developer workflow scripts (efficiency / automation)

A workflow review found CI is already comprehensive (lint → typecheck → coverage → dup → build → audit),
but two local actions were repetitive/manual: running the gate as four separate commands, and packaging a
release archive with a long hand-maintained `zip -x …` exclude list — which reinvented `git archive` (the
repo already has `.gitattributes` `export-ignore` for exactly this).

- **`npm run check`** — one-shot local gate: `lint && test && build` (typecheck runs inside `build`, so no
  redundant `tsc`). Mirrors the core CI gate in a single command; run it before pushing.
- **`npm run package`** — `git archive --format=zip -o sensei-app-2026.zip HEAD`: a clean, portable source
  archive (tracked files only, respects `export-ignore`), replacing the fragile manual `zip` command.
  Packages committed HEAD, so uncommitted WIP is never shipped. `*.zip` added to `.gitignore`.
- Documented both in the README "Running" section. No product/runtime change.

### Changed — empty states now offer a recovery action (no dead-ends)

Reviewed every empty state. The genuinely-empty screens (Patients, Sessions) already have create-actions,
and Calendar has refresh + new-event; the gaps were **filtered-empty** states that stranded the user:

- **Documents** ("אין מסמכים בקטגוריה זו") — added a "הצגת כל המסמכים" button that clears the status filter.
- **Reports** ("לא נמצאו דוחות תואמים") — added a "ניקוי החיפוש והסינון" button (when filtering) that resets
  search + filter; copy adapts to whether a filter is active.
- **Messages** ("אין שיחות תואמות") — added a "ניקוי החיפוש" link that clears the conversation search/filter.
- Reuses existing tokens + the app's clear-filter pattern; guarded by `tests/emptyStateRecovery.test.tsx`.

Lint 0, typecheck 0, **34 files / 242 tests**, production build clean, no UI regression.

---

## [1.0.55] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed — Timeline now has a breadcrumb back to the patient (navigation consistency)

A UX/navigation audit found the patient **Timeline** (ציר זמן) was the only patient sub-page **without a
breadcrumb** back to the patient — Summary, Report, Letter and Transcript all have one, and Upload/Patient
too. In this router-less SPA there is no browser Back, so the timeline was a mild dead-end (you had to use
the sidebar or the patient-switcher).

- Added the standard breadcrumb to `TimelinePage` — `{patient name} › ציר זמן`, with the patient name
  linking back to the patient (`navigate('patient')`), matching the exact markup + `.tl-crumb:hover` style
  the sibling sub-pages use. No other change.
- Verified live: the crumb renders (`מיכל כהן › ציר זמן`) and clicking the name returns to the patient page.
- Guarded by a new `tests/canonical.test.ts` assertion that **every** patient sub-page (Summary/Timeline/
  Report/Letter/Transcript) has a `-crumb` breadcrumb + a `navigate('patient')` handler, so this consistency
  can't silently regress.

Lint 0, typecheck 0, **34 files / 240 tests**, production build clean, no other UI/UX change.

---

## [1.0.54] — 2026-07-05

### Changed — search-match highlighting completed across all list pages (UX consistency)

Following the patients-list highlighting (1.0.52), the two remaining list pages with a text search now
highlight the matched term via the app's canonical `hlParts` — so every search surface (global search, ⌘K
palette, search page, transcript, patients, sessions, resources) reads consistently, making it obvious why
each result matched.

- **`SessionsPage`** — highlights the matched term in the session's patient **name** and **topic chips**.
- **`ResourcesPage`** — highlights the match in the resource **title** and **description**.
- **Documents & Tasks** were reviewed and intentionally excluded — they filter by status/category only (no
  free-text search), so there is nothing to highlight.
- No new logic/styles — the existing `hlParts` + `--selection` token; filtering/sorting unchanged. Verified
  live (sessions "דנה" → 2 highlights; resources "CBT" → 1). Guarded by `tests/listSearchHighlight.test.tsx`.

### Added — behavioural test coverage for 8 previously-untested journeys

Expanded the suite (each self-verified, no `src/` changes): `clipboard` (copy-to-clipboard + Snackbar toast),
`notifications` (unread count / mark-read / filter), `commandPalette` (⌘K type → filter → navigate),
`editPatient` (edit dialog prefill + save), `emptyStates` (patients/sessions no-results + recovery),
`pagerInteraction` (page-through changes rows), `mergeFlow` (dedup merge removes the duplicate, keeps
canonical), and `listSearchHighlight` (sessions/resources highlight).

Lint 0, typecheck 0, **34 files / 239 tests** (3 consecutive green runs), production build clean, no UI/UX
regression, no backend/network in tests.

---

## [1.0.53] — 2026-07-04

### Added — tests for the accessibility-preference appliers (no UI change)

Coverage pass targeting the last clearly-untested core feature: the **user accessibility preferences**. The
a11y suite already covers axe + keyboard combobox, but the preference *appliers* — a real WCAG feature — had
no test.

- **`tests/a11yPrefs.test.tsx` (4)** — `setA11y` / `resetA11y` write to the document root: safe defaults on
  mount, each preference toggling its `data-a11y-*` attribute (contrast/motion/focus/reading/underline), the
  text-size setting mapping to `<html>` zoom (small .9 / large 1.15 / xlarge 1.3), and `resetA11y` restoring
  every default. Drives the real store via the `useApp()` context (the `pager.test` probe pattern); no DOM
  mocks.

Confirmed the global ⌘K palette shortcut is already exercised (a11y suite dispatches the keydown), so no
redundant shortcut tests were added. Documented `patientsSearch` + `a11yPrefs` in TESTING.md and refreshed
counts. Lint 0, typecheck 0, **24→25 files / 215 tests** (3 consecutive green runs), build clean, no
backend/network/UI change.

---

## [1.0.52] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — patients-list search highlights matches (search consistency)

The patients list filtered on search but did not highlight the matched term — the same gap just fixed for
the transcript. Five list pages share this (patients, sessions, documents, resources, tasks); patients is
the highest-traffic and its search matches by **topic/focus** as well as name, so a highlight makes it
obvious *why* each patient matched (e.g. searching "חרדה" shows which patients' focus contains it).

- `PatientsPage` now renders the patient **name and focus** through the app's canonical `hlParts`
  highlighter — the same one the global search, ⌘K palette, search page, and transcript use — so search
  reads consistently across the app. Filtering, sorting, and all other behaviour are unchanged; the
  highlight uses the existing `--selection` token (no new styles/logic).
- Verified live (dark mode): searching "חרדה" highlights the term in the matched patient's focus line;
  name searches highlight the name; clearing the query removes highlighting.
- Added `tests/patientsSearch.test.tsx` (2): topic match highlights the focus, name match highlights and
  clears.

Lint 0, typecheck 0, **23→24 files / 211 tests** (3 consecutive green runs), build clean, no other change.
(The four remaining list searches — sessions/documents/resources/tasks — can adopt the same helper later;
left for a focused follow-up rather than a broad sweep.)

---

## [1.0.51] — 2026-07-04

### Added — behavioural tests for the upload flow and theme application (no UI change)

Another coverage pass targeting the remaining untested critical journeys. Two new deterministic suites; no
redundant tests, no UI/UX/logic changes, no new dependencies, no live APIs.

- **`tests/upload.test.tsx` (2)** — the audio-upload state machine (previously only `validateFile` unit +
  demo-gating): an unsupported file dropped on the zone shows the "אינו נתמך" format error (MP3/WAV/M4A),
  and a supported file leaves the idle drop zone for the processing pipeline. Drives the real `S.upload`
  store via a `drop` event; asserts the immediate state transition, not the simulated progress timer.
- **`tests/theme.test.tsx` (2)** — theme application to the document (`resolveTheme` is unit-tested pure;
  this covers the DOM side effect): the persisted preference is applied to `<html data-theme>` on load, and
  the app-bar theme control toggles light → dark.
- Also documented `transcript`/`upload`/`theme` in TESTING.md and refreshed suite counts.

Verified: lint 0, typecheck 0, production build clean, **21→23 files / 209 tests**, four consecutive green
runs (deterministic), no backend touched, no network in tests, no visual/behavioural change to the app.

---

## [1.0.50] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — transcript search now highlights matches (canonical highlighter, consistency fix)

A review of the recording/transcription module (a client-side *simulated* pipeline — no live mic/API, so
capture/permission/waveform items are N/A by design) found the module already canonical (`validateFile`,
`sessions` data, and `S.upload` state are each single-sourced; no duplication). One genuine inconsistency:
the **transcript in-viewer search only filtered lines — it did not highlight the matched term**, while the
global search, ⌘K palette, and search page all highlight via the shared `hlParts` helper.

- `TranscriptPage` now renders matched lines through the **existing canonical `hlParts`** highlighter
  (no new logic), so the matched term is bolded on the `--selection` token — identical to search everywhere
  else in the app. Filtering behaviour is unchanged. Verified live (dark mode): searching "הצגה" filters to
  the 3 matching lines and highlights the term in each, at ~7:1 contrast.
- Added `tests/transcript.test.tsx` (3): two-sided transcript renders (speaker labels + timestamps), a query
  filters *and* highlights, and clearing restores all lines with no highlight.

No other change: the module's UX, states (idle/uploading/success/error, skeleton-loading, no-results), copy,
and design-system usage were verified consistent and left intact. Lint 0, typecheck 0, **20→21 files /
205 tests**, build clean.

## [1.0.49] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — public-release privacy/secrets audit: removed developer traces (no product change)

A strict pre-publish privacy/PII/secrets audit of the whole repo found no exposed secrets, credentials, or
real PII, but three developer-machine traces and one release-safety gap — all fixed. Product behavior,
UI, UX, and demo data are unchanged.

- **Local machine paths + username removed.** `.claude/launch.json` carried `"cwd":
  "/Users/lital/Desktop/sensei-app-2026"` twice, and `PORTING_GUIDE.md` embedded a
  `/private/tmp/.../-Users-lital/...` scratch path — both leaked a local username. Dropped the redundant
  `cwd` (the runner defaults to the project root) and replaced the doc path with a neutral placeholder.
- **Landing URL dropped** from a `tokens.css` comment (`https://sensei-say.netlify.app/`) — a stray deploy
  reference, comment-only, no behavior impact.
- **`.gitignore` hardened** to prevent accidental secret/local-file commits: `.env` / `.env.*` are now
  ignored while `.env.example` (the safe, empty template) stays tracked; also `.vite` and `*.log`.

Verified clean: no `lital`/local-path/secret/`netlify` references remain in tracked files (excluding the
required Heebo `OFL.txt` font license and standard `package-lock` sponsor URLs). Seed demo data (therapist
`ד״ר רותם שגב`, patients) is fictional/placeholder — intentional and left intact. Lint 0, typecheck 0,
202 tests, build clean.

## [1.0.48] — 2026-07-04

### Added — behavioural tests for three untested critical flows + a flaky-test fix (no UI change)

A second coverage pass over the already-mature suite (17 files / 194 tests) targeted the remaining
behavioural gaps that static guards and smoke tests did not exercise. Three new deterministic suites, no
redundant tests, no UI/UX/logic changes, no new dependencies, no live APIs.

- **`tests/routing.test.tsx` (2)** — the state-driven router's safety net: an unknown/stale `route` key
  falls back to the dashboard (no crash, no blank, not the error card), while known routes still render
  their own screen. Guards the `PAGES[route] || PAGES.dashboard` fallback.
- **`tests/globalSearch.test.tsx` (3)** — the app-bar search journey end to end: a matching query opens the
  results listbox with a selectable option, a no-match query shows the "לא נמצאו תוצאות" empty state (not a
  broken panel), and clearing the query closes it. Exercises real store + ranking.
- **`tests/patientLifecycle.test.tsx` (3)** — the highest-risk destructive flow: deleting a patient requires
  confirmation, removes the record on confirm, offers a working undo that restores it, and keeps the record
  when cancelled. The patient name is read from the confirmation dialog, so assertions hold regardless of
  list sort/pagination.
- **Flaky-test fix.** Adding three more full-`App` suites raised parallel load and exposed a latent race in
  the existing `formValidation` focus assertion (fixed 80 ms delay vs. an asynchronously-applied focus). Made
  it deterministic with `waitFor` (poll until focus lands) — the root cause, not a skip. Full suite verified
  green on three consecutive runs.

Verified: lint 0, typecheck 0, production build clean, **20 files / 202 tests**, no backend touched, no
network in tests, no visual/behavioural change to the app.

## [1.0.47] — 2026-07-04

### Removed — Professional Development (CPD / "התפתחות מקצועית") feature, in full

Per product decision, the Professional Development feature was removed. Footprint mapped first, then
removed with no dangling references.

- **Page & style deleted:** `CpdPage.tsx` (CPD-hours ring, license-renewal card, course cards) and `cpd.css`.
- **Navigation/routing:** the `cpd` destination removed from `navConfig` and `ROUTE_TITLES`, and from the
  lazy `PAGES` map — sidebar now **13** destinations; the "ידע ומשאבים" group keeps ספריית משאבים + מסמכים
  (non-empty, no gap). Palette + global search drop it automatically (shared `navConfig`). Content routes
  24 → **23**.
- **State:** the exclusive keys `cpdCourse` / `cpdLogged` removed from the seed and from `PERSIST_KEYS`.
  No shared state touched (`profile` etc. untouched).
- **Tests & docs:** `navConfig` contract updated (13 destinations, 23 routes; no-orphan + distinct-icon
  guards still hold); route-smoke and axe suites auto-adjusted; README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, and
  TESTING route counts synced to 23.

Verified: lint 0, typecheck 0, production build clean (no broken imports), **no console errors** on a fresh
server, remaining app renders and navigates unchanged. Suite: 17 files, **194 tests**.

---

## [1.0.46] — 2026-07-04

### Added — test coverage for three real gaps + a TESTING.md guide (no UI/UX change)

A coverage review of the existing suite (15 files / 180 tests, ~87% logic-layer) found three genuine,
high-value behavioural gaps and one missing doc. Filled only those — no redundant tests for already-covered
areas, no UI/UX/logic changes, no new dependencies, no live-API calls.

- **`tests/hebrewGrammar.test.ts` (11 tests)** — the gendered-Hebrew microcopy engine (`hg` / `hgTerm`),
  which decides the grammatical gender of nearly every Hebrew string in the app, had no direct unit test.
  Now covers `[[masc|fem|neutral]]` resolution by Hebrew gender code, inline substitution, multi-token
  templates, unmarked-masculine and neutral fallbacks, liberal gender inputs, the definite-article form,
  unknown-term fallback, and graceful degradation when `window.HG` is absent. Exercises the real resolver
  (loaded by `tests/setup.ts`), not a mock.
- **`tests/authFlow.test.tsx` (5 tests)** — the login screen's client-side validation and logout teardown
  were only smoke-rendered. Now covers: malformed-email rejection (announced via `role="alert"`, fields
  `aria-invalid`), too-short-password message, valid credentials entering the loading submit state
  (button `disabled` + `aria-busy`), Enter-key submission, and logout returning to the login screen while
  closing open overlays. Timers are asserted (loading state), never advanced — deterministic, non-flaky.
- **`TESTING.md`** — the required testing guide: stack, run commands, folder structure, suite map, mocking
  strategy (why no MSW — the API layer is dormant; `fetch` is stubbed in `apiClient.test`), coverage
  expectations (logic-layer-scoped, presentational via smoke/axe), TDD workflow, and honest known
  limitations (no E2E/Playwright, no visual-regression). Linked from README; complements — does not
  duplicate — CONTRIBUTING's enforcement contract.

Verified: lint 0, typecheck 0, production build clean, **17 files / 196 tests** (was 15 / 180), no backend
files touched, no network in tests.

---

## [1.0.45] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — documentation drift + dead code (frontend documentation audit)

A frontend documentation-accuracy audit (every doc claim verified against source) found two real drifts
and one duplicated source of truth; all resolved. No BLOCKERs — no critical behavior was undocumented or
unverifiable.

- **Dead MUI theme removed.** `src/theme/sensei-theme.js` was a MUI `createTheme` object that mirrored
  `tokens.css` and claimed to "power the authenticated system" — but it was **never imported** (verified),
  the app uses no MUI (deps are `react`/`react-dom` only), and it duplicated the color source of truth.
  Deleted the file (and the now-empty `src/theme/`), and removed the "MUI theme mirror" references from
  README and ARCHITECTURE plus the stale "MUI-palette aligned" comment in `tokens.css`. The stack is now
  internally consistent: `tokens.css` is the single, sole source of truth for color.
- **Route-count drift corrected.** After the Clinic-Management removal (1.0.44) two stragglers still read
  "26" — `ARCHITECTURE.md` ("26 lazy-loaded pages") and `README.md` ("route smoke (all 26)") — now **24**,
  matching `ROUTE_TITLES` / `ALL_ROUTES`.

Verified: lint 0, typecheck 0, production build clean (dead file removal broke nothing), 180 tests. Docs
now match the implementation; Storybook remains absent (documented debt, not claimed to exist — no drift).

---

## [1.0.44] — 2026-07-04

### Removed — Clinic Management ("המרפאה") section, in full

Per product decision, the entire "המרפאה" (The Practice) section and all its Clinic-Management
functionality were removed. Scope was mapped first, then removed with no dangling references.

- **Pages & styles deleted:** `TeamPage.tsx` (צוות המרפאה), `SupervisionPage.tsx` (סופרוויז׳ן) and their
  `team.css` / `supervision.css`.
- **Navigation:** the `המרפאה` sidebar section and its two destinations removed from `navConfig` — the
  sidebar now shows **14** destinations in three groups + the pinned utility group (no empty header, no
  layout gap). Because sidebar, ⌘K palette and global search share `navConfig`, all three drop the routes
  together.
- **Routing:** `team` / `supervision` removed from the lazy `PAGES` map and from `ROUTE_TITLES` (content
  routes 26 → **24**). A stale persisted `team`/`supervision` route now resolves via the existing
  unknown-route fallback to the dashboard — verified live (no crash, no blank screen).
- **State:** the exclusive keys `teamSearch`, `teamRole`, `supTab`, `supCaseStatus` removed from the seed,
  and `supCaseStatus` dropped from `PERSIST_KEYS`. No shared state touched.
- **Tests & docs:** `navConfig` contract updated (14 destinations, 24 routes; the no-orphan and distinct-icon
  guards still hold); route-smoke and axe suites auto-adjusted; README + CONTRIBUTING route counts updated.

Verified: lint 0, typecheck 0, production build clean (no broken imports), **no console errors** on a fresh
server, and the remaining app renders and navigates unchanged. Suite: 15 files, 180 tests. *Note:* the
Reports feature still contains an unrelated report row titled "סיכום פעילות המרפאה" (a practice-activity
report, not part of the removed section) — left intact to avoid altering a separate feature; say the word to
remove it too.

---

## [1.0.43] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — dark-mode readability & consistency (form controls + brand accent cards)

An empirical dark-mode contrast sweep (measuring computed colours against composited backdrops, both
themes) found the headline "black text on dark input" risk was already prevented by `color-scheme`, but
surfaced four genuine gaps and closed them. Avatar-initial "failures" were confirmed **false positives**
(≥6:1 once the 0.2-alpha chip is composited) and correctly left alone.

- **Form-control text tokenized.** The app never set input/textarea/select `color` itself — entered text
  was whatever the browser's `color-scheme` chose (pure white in dark, a UA colour elsewhere), not the
  design token. Pinned `input,textarea,select` to `var(--text)` so entered text, caret and selected value
  are AA and token-consistent in both themes (dark `#E9F0FB`, light `#0C1B3B`) instead of browser-decided.
- **Brand accent cards darken in dark mode.** Five cards (Help, CPD, Report, Dashboard banner, AI-assistant
  header) painted white/`--paper` text on `linear-gradient(--primary-darker,--primary)`. In dark mode
  `--primary` lightens to `#4D94F5`, dropping small white labels to **3.06:1**. Added tokenised gradient
  stops (`--accent-grad-1/2`) that equal the primary blues in light mode but **darken in dark mode**, plus
  a constant `--on-accent` text token — so light mode is pixel-identical and dark mode is comfortably AA.
- **CPD "register" button.** Hard-coded `#fff` on `--primary` (3.06:1 in dark) → `var(--paper)` like every
  other primary button (5.33:1), correct in both themes.
- **Support-email pill.** White pill with `var(--primary)` text fell to 3.06:1 in dark (the lightened
  primary on white) → `var(--primary-darker)` (4.85:1 dark, ~10:1 light).

Net effect: every measured text node across the audited screens now meets WCAG AA in dark mode, and three
hard-coded `#fff` literals were replaced by tokens (hex-ratchet 66 → 63). Guarded in `tests/canonical.test.ts`
(form-control colour pinned; accent-gradient tokens defined and darkened for dark mode). Suite: 15 files,
184 tests.

---

## [1.0.42] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — Settings & Help stay reachable as the sidebar grows (pinned utility group)

- Measuring the reorganized 16-item sidebar (1.0.41) on a **1366×768 laptop** — one of the most common
  resolutions — found the destination list overflows the viewport: the nav scrolled, and **Settings and
  Help were clipped 288px below the fold**, reachable only if the user discovered the sidebar scrolls. Two
  everyday utility destinations were effectively hidden, and it would worsen with every new feature.
- Introduced a **pinned utility group**: sections flagged `pinned` in `navConfig` (currently "כללי" →
  Settings + Help) render in a fixed block at the bottom of the nav, outside the scrolling area, so they
  are **always visible** above the profile footer while the content categories scroll in the middle. This
  is the standard "settings pinned to the bottom" pattern and it makes the nav scale — new categories grow
  the scrollable middle without ever pushing the utility items off-screen.
- Kept everything inside the single `<nav>` landmark (scrollable main list + pinned block), so no
  destination leaves the navigation landmark — no accessibility regression. Verified live: at 1366×768 the
  middle scrolls while Settings + Help sit pinned and fully visible (87px above the sidebar bottom); the
  mobile nav drawer shows the same pinned group. Guarded in `tests/navConfig.test.ts` (exactly one pinned
  section, holding settings + help). Suite: 15 files, 182 tests.

---

## [1.0.41] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — sidebar navigation reorganized; five stranded features made reachable

- A navigation/IA review found **five fully-built top-level pages had no entry point anywhere in the app** —
  `analytics` (תובנות), `reports` (דוחות), `team` (צוות המרפאה), `supervision` (סופרוויז׳ן) and `cpd`
  (התפתחות מקצועית) were lazy-loaded, titled and route-smoke-tested, yet unreachable: absent from the sidebar,
  the ⌘K palette and global search (all three derive from `navConfig`), with no link from any page. Real
  functionality, invisible to users.
- Reorganized the sidebar from two loose groups into a clear, scannable hierarchy, and folded the stranded
  pages into the category each belongs to:
  - **Primary workspace** (no header): דף הבית · מטופלים · יומן · הקלטות ותמלולים · הודעות · משימות — the daily drivers.
  - **ניתוח ומדדים** (Analysis & Metrics): מדדי תוצאה · **תובנות** · **דוחות**.
  - **ידע ומשאבים** (Knowledge & Resources): ספריית משאבים · מסמכים · **התפתחות מקצועית**.
  - **המרפאה** (The Practice): **צוות המרפאה** · **סופרוויז׳ן**.
  - **כללי** (General): הגדרות · עזרה ותמיכה.
  This replaces the previous "טיפול קליני" group, which incoherently mixed outcome measures with the resource
  library and documents. Because sidebar + palette + search share `navConfig`, all five now surface in **all
  three** at once. Each new item has a distinct icon (guarded). The maintenance-only `dedup` tool stays
  contextual off Patients rather than cluttering the rail.
- Scales cleanly: new features slot into an existing category instead of extending a flat list. Guarded by a
  new `tests/navConfig.test.ts` assertion that **every navigable top-level route has a sidebar entry** (no
  orphaned routes can regress in), plus the updated 16-destination contract. Verified live: the structure
  renders in five groups and the formerly-unreachable Team page now opens from the sidebar. Suite: 15 files,
  181 tests.

---

## [1.0.40] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — "מטופלים אחרונים" in the command palette is now genuinely recent

- A feature-gap review against the product standard found the ⌘K palette shows a section labelled
  **"מטופלים אחרונים" (Recent Patients)** on an empty query — but the data was **`S.patients.slice(0, 4)`**,
  i.e. the first four patients in seed order, never the ones the therapist actually just opened. The label
  made a promise the data didn't keep, and a returning user got no zero-effort way to jump back to the file
  they were last in (search requires typing a name; this is instant recall).
- Made the label true with a small, deterministic tracking layer — no new screen, nav item, or dependency:
  - **`pushRecent(list, id, cap)`** (in `utils`) — a pure most-recent-first, de-duplicated, capped list op.
    Re-viewing the patient already at the head is a no-op, so it is safe to call on every navigation.
  - **`store.navigate`** records the engaged patient into `recentPatientIds` whenever a `patientId` is
    carried (opening a file, summary, timeline, letter…). The key is added to `PERSIST_KEYS`, so recency
    survives reloads — consistent with the app's multi-device-continuity model.
  - **Command palette** derives the section from `recentPatientIds`, falling back to the first few only on a
    fresh session so the list is never empty. Verified live: after viewing p5 then p3, the section shows
    `[p3, p5]` most-recent-first — including p5, which the old first-four slice could never surface.
- Guarded by `pushRecent` unit tests (move-to-front, dedup, cap, idempotency, empty/undefined input) and a
  `tests/canonical.test.ts` assertion that the palette reads tracked history and the store records it. Suite:
  15 files, 180 tests.

---

## [1.0.39] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — the dedup engine now owns confidence + canonical selection (single source of truth)

- A deduplication/canonicalization review found the clustering engine (`buildDupClusters`) returned only
  raw members + per-signal scores, while **two derived facts the whole flow depends on — the cluster's
  confidence and which record is canonical — were re-derived in the UI**: `DedupPage` computed confidence
  from the meta scores and picked the surviving record by session count, and the merge dialog fell back to
  a *different* default (`members[0]`, i.e. seed order). Same concept, three places, one latent
  inconsistency.
- Made the engine the authority. Each cluster now carries two deterministic, first-class fields:
  - **`confidence`** — the cluster's strongest member score (0–99).
  - **`canonicalId`** — the proposed surviving record: most complete first (highest session count), ties
    broken by lowest id, so the same input always yields the same canonical pick.
  `DedupPage` and the merge dialog now **read these instead of re-deriving them**, so the confidence shown,
  the "רשומה ראשית מוצעת" (proposed primary) badge, and the merge's default survivor can never drift apart.
- **No change to clustering behaviour** — the weighted signals (phone 60 / surname 25 / first-name 15 /
  email 12) and the ≥ 60 threshold are untouched; these fields are pure functions of an existing cluster.
  For the seed's intentional `{p2, p9}` fixture the values are identical to before (confidence 99, canonical
  `p2`). Locked by three assertions in `tests/dedup.test.ts` (confidence, canonical pick, deterministic
  tie-break). Suite: 15 files, 180 tests.

---

## [1.0.38] — 2026-07-04

### Added — Help is reachable from anywhere, with minimal effort

- A UX review found the Help page (FAQ, keyboard-shortcut catalog, support contact + hours, and the
  onboarding-guide/tutorial restore) was **rich but hard to reach**: `help` was a real route yet was
  **absent from `navConfig`**, so it never appeared in the sidebar, the ⌘K palette (from navConfig), or
  global search. The only paths to it were ⌘K (a keyboard shortcut a non-technical therapist won't
  know) and two contextual links (Upload, Settings). On mobile — where ⌘K isn't available — there was
  effectively no discoverable route to help.
- Made Help a **first-class destination**, reachable from every screen with one interaction:
  - **`navConfig`** now lists `help` under the "כללי" (General) section. Because the sidebar, the ⌘K
    command palette, and global search all derive from `navConfig`, Help now appears in **all three
    from a single source** — persistent in the sidebar rail on desktop and in the nav drawer on mobile.
  - **App bar** gains an always-visible **"?" help button** (the top-bar convention) — zero-click
    visible, one-click to Help, on every route. It's hidden on the tight phone app bar (≤560px), where
    Help lives in the nav drawer instead, so no mobile control is crowded off-screen.
  - **Removed the now-redundant** one-off static "עזרה ותמיכה" command from the palette — it flows from
    `navConfig` now, so the palette shows it exactly once (verified). Net result is *less* special-case
    code, not more.
- No new page, content, or dependency — this is pure discoverability for an existing capability.
  Guarded in `tests/canonical.test.ts` (Help must stay a navConfig destination + carry an app-bar
  affordance, and must not be double-listed in the palette) and `tests/navConfig.test.ts` (the SSOT
  destination contract now expects 11 destinations). Suite: 15 files, 174 tests.

---

## [1.0.37] — 2026-07-04

### Added — print stylesheet so the clinical letter prints as a document, not the app

- A product/UX review of existing-but-unfinished capabilities found `LetterPage` ships a working
  **"הדפסה"** button (`window.print()`), but the app defined **no `@media print` rule anywhere** — so
  printing a formal clinical referral letter (for a patient file / insurer / referring clinician) also
  printed the entire app chrome: sidebar, app bar, search, the floating AI button, and the page's own
  action buttons. The output was unusable as a professional document. Added a single `@media print`
  block in `global.css` that hides all app chrome and anything tagged `.no-print`, whitens the page,
  and neutralizes shadows/padding on `#main-content`, so only the letter reaches paper/PDF. Tagged the
  `LetterPage` breadcrumb row and action buttons `.no-print`. **On-screen appearance is unchanged**;
  no new dependency, no logic change. Guarded by an assertion in `tests/canonical.test.ts`.
- Verified the print result on-screen by emulating the rules live (app bar + sidebar collapse to
  hidden, the letter document remains) and confirmed the `@media print` block ships in the built CSS
  bundle. Final paper output is best confirmed once with the browser's Print preview (Ctrl/⌘-P).

---

## [1.0.36] — 2026-07-04

### Added — error observability (the ErrorBoundary no longer swallows errors silently)

- A production-readiness review found the page-level `ErrorBoundary` caught render errors (showing a
  recoverable card) but **logged nothing** — a caught crash left zero operator trace, violating "if it
  runs in production it must be observable." Added `componentDidCatch` that logs the error, the failing
  route, and the component stack via `console.error`. This surfaces caught errors in the console / any
  log capture and is the **single documented hook** to wire a real error reporter (e.g. Sentry) later,
  without touching the recovery UI. Guarded by an assertion in `tests/errorBoundary.test.tsx`.
- The rest of the reliability review was re-verified robust and needed no change: `localStorage` load
  **and** save are both `try/catch`-guarded (corrupted state / quota errors degrade gracefully), and an
  unknown/stale persisted route falls back to the dashboard (`PAGES[route] || PAGES.dashboard`) under
  the ErrorBoundary + Suspense. Suite: 15 files, 172 tests.

---

## [1.0.35] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — placeholder text contrast (WCAG 1.4.3), app-wide

- A UX/contrast audit found the app defined **no `::placeholder` style**, so all 32 placeholder
  inputs fell back to the browser-default gray (`#757575` ≈ **4.05:1** in light mode) — just below
  AA. Added one global rule pinning placeholders to `var(--text-muted)` (`opacity:1` to stop Firefox
  dimming). Verified live: **light 4.63:1, dark 4.58:1** — AA in both themes. Guarded in
  `tests/canonical.test.ts`.
- The rest of the audit (navigation, IA, forms, empty/loading/error states, keyboard operability,
  copy, responsiveness, trust messaging) was re-verified and clean; several sweep flags (sidebar nav,
  agenda text) were confirmed to be measurement artifacts on precise re-inspection (5.5–17:1). Suite:
  15 files, 172 tests.

---

## [1.0.34] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — two dark-mode contrast failures (WCAG 1.4.3), found by empirical measurement

Measuring *actual rendered* contrast (the token-based test can't see composited/on-accent colors)
surfaced two real dark-mode failures, both fixed with light mode left identical:

- **Skip link** was `#fff` on `var(--primary)` = **3.06:1**. In dark mode `--primary` lightens
  (`#4D94F5`), so white text fails AA. Switched to `var(--paper)` (the on-accent contract) →
  **5.33:1** dark / ~5.5:1 light. Guarded in `tests/canonical.test.ts`.
- **Patient-avatar initials** used a same-hue tint bg + saturated text, which collapsed to
  **1.46–2.63:1** in dark mode (the darkest hue nearly invisible). `avatarColors` is now theme-aware:
  in dark mode it deepens the tint and lifts the initials toward white (keeping each patient's hue) →
  **6.07–6.88:1**, verified live. Light mode unchanged. A new `utils.test.ts` case proves AA with the
  WCAG math.

Other element types measured (text, buttons, chips, nav, inputs, disabled) passed; the earlier flags
(sidebar, avatar "1.0" ratios) were measurement artifacts, confirmed clean on precise re-inspection.
Suite: 15 files, 171 tests.

---

## [1.0.33] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — enabled safe stricter TS checks + removed dead code they surfaced

Full `strict` (null/any) stays deferred (it needs the larger migration), but the **independent**
compiler safety checks that pass clean are now on — hardening the codebase against whole bug classes
at zero runtime cost:

- `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noImplicitOverride`,
  `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`.
- Fixing what they surfaced (15 issues, all compile-time, no behavior change): **removed 10 unused
  `React` imports** (dead code the ESLint config missed — unnecessary under the `react-jsx`
  transform); added `override` to the 3 `ErrorBoundary` members that override `React.Component`; made
  two early `return` paths in `useFocusTrap` explicit (`return undefined`).

The compiler now catches unused code, missing returns, accidental non-overrides, and cross-platform
casing mismatches on every build. Verified: typecheck 0 · lint 0 · 169 tests · build clean.

---

## [1.0.32] — 2026-07-04

### Added — explicit cache-control (cache-safety): immutable assets, revalidated HTML

- A cache-safety audit found the deploy configs set security headers but **no `Cache-Control`**,
  leaving cache behavior to implicit host defaults — the classic stale-UI trap (a returning user gets
  cached HTML pointing at old/purged asset hashes → dead chunks). Made it explicit in both
  `vercel.json` and `public/_headers`:
  - `/assets/*` (Vite content-hashed) → `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
  - HTML (`index.html` + SPA routes) → `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`
  So HTML always revalidates and pulls the current asset hashes, while hashed assets cache forever.
  Config-only; no code, UI, or behavior change. Guarded in `tests/canonical.test.ts`.
- **Intentionally not added** (would be feature additions the caching split already makes unnecessary):
  a Service Worker (none exists — nothing to keep in sync), a runtime "new version available" toast
  (with `max-age=0` HTML the next navigation/reload already serves the latest), and chunk-load-error
  auto-reload (risks reload loops; near-impossible here since the host retains immutable assets).

Suite: 15 files, 169 tests.

---

## [1.0.31] — 2026-07-04

### Optimized — removed 1.1 MB of dead image assets (production build 2.6 MB → 1.5 MB)

- A production-optimization pass measured `public/assets/` and found two brand PNGs referenced
  **nowhere** in source: `sensei-enso.png` (928 KB) and `sensei-write.png` (158 KB). Everything under
  `public/` ships as-is, so these were dead weight in every deployment. Removed both after confirming
  zero references (static and dynamic). **Production build dropped 2.6 MB → 1.5 MB (−1.1 MB, ~42%)**,
  with no functional or visual change. Verified live: no broken images, the FAB logo loads.
- Added an **asset guard** (`tests/canonical.test.ts`): every image in `public/assets/` must be
  referenced in source, so dead media can't accumulate again.
- **Intentionally left:** the three in-use images (`sensei-mark` logo, `sensei-fan` / `sensei-scroll`
  empty-state art) are somewhat larger than their display size; re-encoding them is a follow-up that
  needs image tooling and visual-fidelity checks, out of scope for a minimal, no-visual-change pass.
  The JS bundle (~78 KB gzip main, 29 lazy route chunks) and font (115 KB variable, `font-display:swap`)
  were already optimized. Suite: 15 files, 168 tests.

---

## [1.0.30] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — removed em dashes from all Hebrew copy (house-style / anti-AI-tell)

- Per an explicit copy directive, replaced **47 em dashes ("—")** across ~25 files with
  context-correct punctuation: **·** for inline label chains (`PTSD · קיפאון בטיפול`), **:** for a
  label then its detail (`סיכום הדרכה: טכניקות`), and a **period or comma** to split an action from
  its follow-up (`הבקשה נשלחה. נחזור אליכם`). Covers page subheadings, toasts, empty states,
  supervision/report titles, help text, and seed copy. Meaning preserved; no layout change.
- The standalone `—` empty-value placeholder (`phone: '—'`) is kept — it is a data indicator, not
  prose. Hebrew prefix hyphens (`ב־`, `ל־`) and technical values stay (grammatically required).
- Added a CI guard (`tests/canonical.test.ts`) that flags any em dash adjacent to Hebrew text, and
  documented the rule in [CONTENT_GUIDE.md](CONTENT_GUIDE.md). Verified live (Tasks subheading now
  uses a comma; no Hebrew-adjacent em dash renders). Suite: 15 files, 167 tests.

---

## [1.0.29] — 2026-07-04

### Added — tests that prove the deduplication engine's properties

The dedup dry-run has been requested repeatedly with an unchanged dataset — its result (one cluster,
`p2`/`p9`, confidence 99, deterministic + idempotent) is stable by design. Rather than keep
re-asserting that in prose, those properties are now **proven automatically**:

- **`tests/dedup.test.ts`** (7 tests) exercises `buildDupClusters` directly: weighted scoring capped at
  99 with the four expected signals; **determinism + idempotency** (same input → byte-identical output
  every run); phone-format normalization; the 60-point threshold (name+email similarity alone, 52,
  does not cluster); **no false positives** for distinct patients; the real seed yields exactly the one
  intentional cluster `{p2, p9}`; and the canonical (de-duplicated) set yields **zero** clusters —
  encoding the "no duplicates remain after merge" success criterion.

No source or data change — the engine and the intentional demo duplicate are unchanged; this locks
the behavior the dry-run keeps confirming. Suite: 15 files, 166 tests.

---

## [1.0.28] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — demo state-preview links showed on the production login page

- The auth screen rendered a *"מצבי מסך (הדגמה)"* ("Screen states — demo") block with links to jump to
  the expired-session and unauthorized screens — a dev/design-review tool that shipped to real users on
  the login page (same class as the 1.0.26 upload demo-link fix). Since `demoMode` is always false
  pre-auth, the correct gate here is build-time: the block is now wrapped in `import.meta.env.DEV`, so
  Vite **tree-shakes it out of the production build** (verified: the label is absent from `dist/`) while
  it stays visible under `npm run dev` for design review.
- Extended the frontend security guard's env allowlist to permit Vite's non-secret build-time built-ins
  (`DEV`/`PROD`/`MODE`/`SSR`/`BASE_URL`) alongside `VITE_API_BASE_URL` — these are compile-time flags,
  never secrets. Added a guard (`tests/canonical.test.ts`) asserting the demo block stays DEV-gated;
  proven to fail if the gate is removed.

---

## [1.0.27] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — upload "choose patient" select silently discarded the user's choice

- The upload page's *"בחירת מטופל להעלאה"* (choose patient for this recording) dropdown listed every
  patient but had **no `value`/`onChange`** — the selection was ignored, and "צפייה בסיכום" always
  navigated to the globally-current patient. So picking patient A and viewing the summary showed
  patient B's — a silent, misleading no-op. (A console-warning sweep across 10 routes + overlays came
  back clean; this was the one real defect.)
- Wired the existing control: options now carry the patient **id** (robust against duplicate names),
  the select is controlled and defaults to the current patient, and `goSummaryFromUpload` navigates to
  the **selected** patient. No new feature — an existing control now honors its input. Verified live
  (select round-trips; summary follows the choice) + a regression test in `tests/demoGating.test.tsx`.

The other selects across the app (filters, appointment, timeline, tasks, settings) were confirmed
already wired.

---

## [1.0.26] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — a demo-only control leaked into the real production UI

- The upload page rendered a *"הדגמת שגיאת פורמט"* ("demo a format error") link **unconditionally** —
  a design-reference device that triggers a fake format error. A real therapist would find it
  confusing, and it violates the "no demo controls in production" standard. It's now gated behind
  `demoMode` (the same flag that drives the demo banner): visible in the design-reference demo, hidden
  in a real session. Verified live (hidden when not in demo mode) and guarded by a new test
  (`tests/demoGating.test.tsx`, both directions). No other ungated demo affordances remain — the auth
  "enter demo" button is the intended, legitimate demo entry point.

---

## [1.0.25] — 2026-07-04

### Added — tests for form validation & error-state accessibility

A feedback-states audit (validation, errors, loading, empty, success, destructive-action, RTL copy)
came back **already complete and well-built** — the notable finding was a *test* gap, not a UX gap:

- **`tests/formValidation.test.tsx`** (3 tests) covers the add-patient form's previously-untested
  validation path — empty submit shows an **announced** error (`role="alert"`) that is programmatically
  wired to the field (`aria-invalid` + `aria-describedby` → the real element) with **focus moved to the
  errored field** (WCAG 3.3.1 / 2.4.3); an out-of-range age is rejected with its specific message and
  the dialog stays open; a valid submission adds the patient and closes the dialog.

No source change — the validation, aria wiring, focus management, and gendered success toast were
already implemented correctly; this locks them against regression. Suite: 13 files, 155 tests.

---

## [1.0.24] — 2026-07-04

### Added — tests for the pager algorithm (biggest coverage gap) + documented TDD workflow

A coverage audit found the logic layer well-tested (~100% of utils/data/hooks/nav/services) **except
the store**: `AppStore.tsx` was at 45% function / 60% branch coverage, and its lowest-covered piece
was `pager()` — the pagination view-model behind the patients / sessions / documents tables, a real
algorithm (slicing, current-page clamping, range labels, prev/next disabled state, and a page-number
sequence with ellipses) with **no tests**.

- **Added `tests/pager.test.tsx`** (6 tests) covering `pager()` edge cases — page slicing + range
  label, out-of-range page clamping, the hide-when-≤6 rule, first-page disabled state, no-ellipsis at
  ≤7 pages, and two-sided ellipsis collapse at many pages — plus the pure `resolveTheme`. Lifted
  overall branch coverage **72% → 78%** and store branch coverage **60% → 72%**.
- **Documented the TDD workflow** in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Red → Green → Refactor for
  new work, the test-layer layout, determinism/isolation conventions, mocking policy, and the
  coverage-quality-over-percentage stance.

Tests + docs only; no behavior change. Suite: 12 files, 152 tests.

---

## [1.0.23] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — AI assistant panel didn't focus its input on open (keyboard/UX)

- An overlay focus-management audit found the shell's overlays consistent **except** the "שאל את סנסיי"
  AI panel: it opened without moving focus to its message input, so a keyboard user had to Tab into the
  panel before typing (the command palette already auto-focuses its input). The panel is **non-modal**
  (no backdrop / `aria-modal`), so a focus trap would be wrong — the fix is just to focus the input on
  open and let focus flow normally otherwise. Escape already closes it via the store's global Escape
  cascade. Verified live (input focused on open; Escape closes) + a new regression test in
  `tests/a11y.test.tsx`.
- Confirmed the other overlays are already correct: modal dialogs and the ⌘K palette trap focus
  (`useFocusTrap`) and restore it; all overlays close via the global Escape cascade.

---

## [1.0.22] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — documentation drift (stale test count) + accuracy audit

A documentation-completeness audit found the doc set accurate and well-scoped except one stale figure:

- **README cited "138 tests" in two places; the suite is 145.** Rather than hardcode a number that
  drifts on every added test, the README now describes the suite by its stable **categories** (unit ·
  route smoke · a11y · canonical guards) and lists the current guard set (copy-integrity, heading-order,
  emoji, version-consistency). The historical "138 / 35 tests" figures inside older CHANGELOG entries are
  left intact — they're an accurate record of their versions.
- Verified the rest is synchronized: ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, CONTENT_GUIDE, and the README doc-index
  match the current implementation; PORTING_GUIDE is marked historical; each topic has one canonical
  owner. Docs-only change; no behavior change.

---

## [1.0.21] — 2026-07-04

### Added — Content & Voice guide + emoji governance; removed 2 emojis from UI content

A content-design audit against the real app came back consistent (single canonical term "מטופל" across
116 uses, no placeholder/lorem/dev text, truthful action copy) with one concrete violation:

- **Removed two 🙏 emojis** from product-authored message strings (`data/seed.ts` demo thread,
  `MessagesPage` canned reply) — both violated the product's "no emoji in UI" convention (emojis render
  inconsistently across platforms, degrade screen-reader output, don't localize). Verified live on fresh
  state: messages render emoji-free.
- **Added an emoji guard** (`tests/canonical.test.ts`): no `.ts`/`.tsx` source may contain an emoji
  (U+1F000–1FAFF). Functional glyphs (↑↓ ↺ →) are intentionally allowed.
- **Added [CONTENT_GUIDE.md](CONTENT_GUIDE.md)** — one consolidated source of truth for voice, the
  terminology dictionary, microcopy/empty/error/success patterns, Hebrew-RTL rules, the truthfulness
  rule, and content governance. Proportional to a single-product app (not 20 separate documents), and it
  explicitly marks what's N/A here (no emails/SMS/push, no presentations, Hebrew-only so no i18n layer, no
  Storybook/Figma). Referenced from README + CONTRIBUTING.

No behavior change; copy/content + docs only.

---

## [1.0.20] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — heading-order skips on empty states (WCAG 1.3.1 / heading hierarchy)

- A frontend-completeness audit found six views jumping straight from `<h1>` to `<h3>` with no
  `<h2>` — five empty-state headings (Patients "אין מטופלים עדיין" / "לא נמצאו…", Dedup, Documents,
  Tasks) and the notifications-popover title. Screen-reader users navigating by heading level hit a
  gap. Changed those to `<h2>`; since each carries an explicit inline font-size, **appearance is
  unchanged** — the fix is purely semantic.
- Added a heading-order guard (`tests/canonical.test.ts`, documented in CONTRIBUTING) — any `.tsx`
  using `<h3>` must also use `<h2>`, and no `<h4>`–`<h6>`. axe couldn't catch these because empty
  states don't render in the route tests.

The rest of the audit came back clean and is documented in the review summary: 26 routes with no
broken/placeholder screens, empty/loading/error states present, dup <5%, bundle ~78 kB gzip main,
all 26 pages self-constrain content width (no large-desktop stretch), no runtime console errors,
axe clean, keyboard-operable search + palette. No other changes were warranted.

---

## [1.0.19] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — command palette (⌘K) now announces the active option to screen readers (WCAG 4.1.2)

- Following the 1.0.18 global-search combobox work, the ⌘K palette was already keyboard-navigable
  (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, `role="listbox"`/`option`, `aria-selected`) — but its input lacked
  `role="combobox"` + `aria-activedescendant`, so a screen-reader user pressing arrows saw the
  highlight move **silently**: the active option was never announced.
- Added `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, and
  `aria-activedescendant` (wired to the active option's `id`) — mirroring the global-search
  combobox so both share one canonical pattern. Verified live (ArrowDown → `aria-activedescendant`
  advances `cmdopt-0 → cmdopt-1 → cmdopt-2`, active row `aria-selected="true"`) and covered by a new
  regression test in `tests/a11y.test.tsx`. Purely additive ARIA; no behavior change.

---

## [1.0.18] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — global search dropdown is now keyboard-operable (WCAG 2.1.1)

- The app-bar global search showed a rich results dropdown (matching patients + quick-nav routes),
  but it was **mouse-only**: `Enter` jumped to the full search page and the result rows were plain
  `<div onClick>` — unreachable by keyboard, violating the "full keyboard operability" standard.
- It is now a proper **combobox**: `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` move a highlighted option,
  `aria-activedescendant` tracks it (rows are `role="option"` in a `role="listbox"`), `Enter` opens
  the highlighted result (or falls back to full search when none is highlighted), and `Escape`
  closes. Mouse hover and keyboard share one active state, so behavior is consistent. The active row
  is highlighted with `var(--primary-surface)`.
- Verified live (ArrowDown highlights → `aria-activedescendant`; Enter navigates to the patient;
  Escape closes) and covered by a new regression test in `tests/a11y.test.tsx`. axe remains clean.

---

## [1.0.17] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — application name unified as "Sensei" (`סנסיי`) + richer metadata

The app name was already consistent in user-facing UI (19 × `סנסיי` — the Hebrew rendering of
Sensei — across the sidebar, auth wordmark, AI assistant, org name, and greeting) and in docs
(`Sensei`), with the per-route `document.title` prefixed `סנסיי ·`. This change tidies the two
remaining spots:

- **Package identifier** `sensei-app-2026` → `sensei`, so the technical name matches the app name.
  (The project folder and preview-server config keep their path for tooling continuity.)
- **HTML metadata** gained `application-name`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `description`,
  `og:title`, and `og:description` — all carrying `סנסיי`, matching the `<title>` and UI brand.
  Verified live: `document.title = "סנסיי · מטופלים"`, `application-name = "סנסיי"`.

The user-facing wordmark is kept in Hebrew (`סנסיי`) to match the all-Hebrew RTL UI; switching it
to a Latin "Sensei" wordmark is a one-line branding change if preferred. No behavior change.

---

## [1.0.16] — 2026-07-04

### Added — regression guard for the 1.0.15 copy fixes + fixed stale doc baseline

- **Extended the copy-integrity guard** (`tests/canonical.test.ts`) to protect the 1.0.15 fixes, not
  just merge: the delete-patient / delete-session dialogs + toasts and the summary-approval status
  must promise no activity-log logging and no N-day retention (immediate undo only). Proven to fail
  CI on a re-added "30 יום" claim. Scoped to those action files, with a documented, principled
  exception: general capability/policy descriptions that represent the demo's audit feature
  (`HelpPage` privacy FAQ, `DocumentsPage` signature note — alongside the equally-represented
  RBAC/PII claims) are intentionally out of scope; only per-action confirmations must be literally
  true in this build.
- **Fixed stale documentation drift:** CONTRIBUTING cited the hardcoded-hex ratchet baseline as
  **82** in two places; the actual guard has used **66** since 1.0.9. Corrected. (The `82` in the
  historical CHANGELOG entry is left as an accurate record of that version.)

Both documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § "Enforcement rules". No dependencies; no
behavior change.

---

## [1.0.15] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — delete/session/summary copy over-promised recovery & audit logging

Follow-through on the 1.0.13 truthfulness pass — the three same-class claims flagged there are now
corrected (verified against actual behavior first):

- **Patient delete** kept the record removable only via the immediate undo toast, but the dialog +
  toast promised *"kept in archive 30 days before final deletion."* Now: *"you can undo the action
  immediately after it's performed."*
- **Session delete** soft-removes to the persisted `deletedSessions` store with immediate undo, but
  claimed *"recoverable within 30 days"* (no expiry logic, no restore surface after the toast). Now
  the same immediate-undo wording.
- **SummaryPage** stated an approval was *"logged to the activity log"*; the Privacy "Audit Log" is a
  static fixture nothing writes to, so that clause is removed.

The true parts are preserved (immediate undo; the verified-on date). Copy-only, no behavior change.
Verified live: delete-patient dialog renders the corrected wording with no "30 days" claim. A sweep
confirms no fabricated retention/audit claims remain anywhere (the notification archive, which is
backed by a real persisted store, is unchanged).

---

## [1.0.14] — 2026-07-04

### Added — Phase 9.5 enforcement: two low-noise guards closing real drift gaps

Most Phase 9.5 enforcement already exists (jscpd duplication guard; single-source-of-truth,
architecture, RTL, hardcoded-hex, docs-exist guards in `tests/canonical.test.ts`; security, axe,
contrast, focus-trap suites; the CI release gate). Several spec areas are structurally N/A here
(no Storybook, no Design-System package, no i18n key system, no backend/API contracts, no
database/migrations). Two genuine gaps are now closed — both deterministic, scoped, and proven to
fail on regression:

- **Version-consistency guard** (`tests/canonical.test.ts`) — the docs guard proved required files
  *exist*; this proves they're not *stale*: `package.json` version must equal the newest CHANGELOG
  heading and the README version badge. A bump in one file that misses the others now fails CI.
- **Copy-integrity guard** (`tests/canonical.test.ts`) — regression protection for the 1.0.13 fix:
  the patient-merge copy must not re-introduce an "archived / restorable / logged to the activity
  log" promise that `confirmMerge` doesn't perform. Scoped to merge-flow lines only, so the
  legitimate notification archive and the separate delete flows are unaffected.

Both documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § "Enforcement rules" with owner, verify
command, failure condition, and rollback. No new dependencies; no behavior change.

---

## [1.0.13] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — patient-merge copy claimed archival + audit logging the code never performs

- A dry-run deduplication scan of the seed dataset found exactly **one** genuine duplicate cluster
  (`p2` יוסי מזרחי / `p9` יוסף מזרחי — identical normalised phone `0527654321`, confidence 99),
  which is intentional demo content for the app's own duplicate-detection feature. No action taken
  on the data (default DRY RUN; the cluster is left in place to exercise the feature).
- **The merge feature's copy over-promised.** The merge dialog and toast (`Dialogs.tsx`) told the
  user the duplicate would be *"moved to archive and can be restored"* and *"logged to the activity
  log,"* but `confirmMerge` filters the record out of state permanently — there is no
  `archivedPatients` store and the Privacy "Audit Log" is a static fixture nothing writes to. The
  copy is now truthful: *"the duplicate record will be removed from the list; sessions merge into
  the primary."* Same unbacked *"logged to the activity log"* line removed from the delete-all-data
  dialog. Behaviour unchanged (copy-only). Verified live: merge dialog renders with no
  archive/audit claim.
- **Reported, not changed (await decision):** the patient-delete and session-delete flows carry the
  same *"recoverable within 30 days"* wording backed only by a transient undo toast, and
  `SummaryPage` states an approval was *"logged to the activity log."* Same class of gap in separate
  features — left for an explicit call rather than reworded unilaterally.

---

## [1.0.12] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — notifications popover clipped off-screen on phones (same class as 1.0.11)

- The notifications popover (opened from the app-bar bell that 1.0.10 made reachable on mobile)
  anchors to the small, off-centre bell with a 360px width. On phones it overran the viewport —
  at 375px its leading edge sat at **+30px past the right edge**, clipping the start of each
  notification row. Fixed with the same viewport-pinned treatment as the search dropdown: at
  ≤560px both app-bar popovers now share one rule (`.appbar-search-panel, .appbar-popover-panel`)
  that pins them to symmetric 16px insets. Verified live at 375px (panel 16→359px, no overflow)
  and 1024px (unchanged, 360px anchored to the bell). This clears the last fixed-width dropdown in
  the app shell — a codebase scan confirms only these two anchored popovers exist in the shell.

---

## [1.0.11] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — global-search results dropdown clipped off-screen on phones

- The app-bar search-results dropdown has `min-width:360px` and anchors to the search box's
  trailing edge. With the search box narrow on phones (post-1.0.10), the 360px panel overran the
  viewport — at 375px its trailing edge sat at **-51px**, clipping the risk badge on every result
  row. At ≤560px the panel is now pinned to the viewport with symmetric 16px insets
  (`position:fixed; left/right:16px; width:auto`), so it fills the width cleanly with nothing cut
  off. Desktop keeps the anchored 360px dropdown (rule only fires ≤560px). Verified live at 375px
  (panel 16→359px, no overflow) and 1024px (unchanged, 360px anchored).

---

## [1.0.10] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — mobile app-bar: unreachable controls + sub-24px touch targets (WCAG 2.2 §2.5.8)

- **Notifications and account controls were clipped off-screen on phones.** The app-bar
  search had `min-width:190px` plus a `flex:1` whitespace spacer, and on narrow widths
  (≤~400px) these squeezed the notifications bell and account/avatar button past the trailing
  edge — rendered at negative coordinates, clipped by the page's overflow guard, and
  **unreachable** (the account menu is also in the drawer, but the notifications panel is not).
  At ≤560px the spacer is now collapsed and the search min-width dropped, so every control stays
  on-screen at 320–560px while the search stays usable (~100px at 375–390px). Desktop layout is
  unchanged (the rule only fires ≤560px). Verified live at 320/375/390 px.
- **Two touch targets were below the 24×24px minimum.** The sidebar logout icon measured
  20×20px (now a 24×24px hit area via transparent padding; the glyph stays 20px), and the
  app-bar theme toggle shrank to 21px wide at mobile because it lacked `flex-shrink:0` (now
  holds its 38×38px). Both verified live at mobile width; no other sub-24px controls remain.

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — dark-mode on-accent contrast (WCAG 1.4.3) + reduced hardcoded-hex debt

- On-accent text (filter chips, toggles, pager, message bubbles, gender selector) used a
  hardcoded `#fff`, which in dark mode is white on the lighter accent (`#4D94F5`) = **3.06:1**,
  below the 4.5:1 AA threshold for normal text. This was invisible to the token-based contrast
  test (it audits tokens, not hardcoded hex). Converted these 16 cases to `var(--paper)` (the
  on-accent color contract): **light mode is unchanged** (`--paper` = `#FFFFFF` = `#fff`), and
  **dark mode now measures 5.33:1** — verified live. Hardcoded-hex ratchet lowered 82 → 66.
- Data-driven avatar backgrounds and on-accent icon fills (pass the 3:1 graphics threshold) keep
  `#fff` intentionally.

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-07-04

### Added — client-ready API layer (dormant; no backend exists yet)

There is no backend to connect to (verified: none on disk or on the linked GitHub account),
so instead of fabricating an integration, added a canonical, typed API layer that stays inert
until a backend is configured — all current flows (seed data + localStorage) are unchanged.

- `src/services/apiClient.ts` — single typed fetch client: base URL from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`,
  Bearer auth via a pluggable token provider (no token hardcoded/stored), timeout + AbortController,
  consistent typed `ApiError`, `isApiConfigured()` gate.
- `src/services/crud.ts` + `index.ts` — generic `ApiService<T>` (list/get/create/update/remove) +
  patients/tasks/documents/notifications/auth service instances.
- `src/types/index.ts` — domain model types (the API contract; mirrors the seed shape).
- **Dormant:** no runtime code imports the layer, so it is tree-shaken from the build.
- Tests: `tests/apiClient.test.ts` (6) — dormant-when-unconfigured, URL/query building, header +
  Bearer injection, error mapping, 204. Architecture guard now covers `services`/`types` as leaf
  modules. Security guard allows exactly `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (client-safe), flags any other env read.
- `.env.example` documents `VITE_API_BASE_URL`; ARCHITECTURE.md gains a "Wiring a backend" section.

Suite: 138 tests green.

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-07-04

### Added — Phase 9.5: automated deduplication & consistency enforcement

- **Canonical/architecture/drift guards** (`tests/canonical.test.ts`, 35 tests): every canonical
  symbol must be defined exactly once in its stated home; leaf modules (`utils/data/hooks/nav`)
  may not import UI/state; no page→page imports; required docs must exist; hardcoded-hex ratchet
  (≤82 baseline, non-increasing).
- **Code-duplication guard**: `jscpd` (`npm run dup`, `.jscpd.json`) fails CI above 5% (current 3.19%,
  min-tokens 80). Verified it rejects when exceeded.
- **Docs**: added `ARCHITECTURE.md` (layer rules + single-source-of-truth map), `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  (enforcement table: owner · verify · failure · rollback · accepted exceptions), `.env.example`
  (honest: no runtime env vars).
- **CI**: `ci.yml` now also runs the duplication guard; the canonical suite runs via `npm test`.

Total suite: 131 tests green.

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — TranscriptPage crash on missing grammar layer (+ closed a test blind spot)

- `TranscriptPage` called `window.HG.term()`/`.fill()` **unguarded**; if `hebrew-grammar.js`
  failed to load, the screen crashed (`Cannot read properties of undefined`). Now uses the
  guarded `hg()` + new `hgTerm()` utils (fall back to the raw term instead of throwing).
  Surfaced by the new coverage run.
- **Test blind spot closed:** the route-smoke + a11y suites passed even when a page crashed,
  because the error-boundary card renders inside `#main-content` and has its own `h1`. Tests now
  load `hebrew-grammar.js` (as `index.html` does) so HG-dependent code runs for real, and the
  route smoke test asserts the error-boundary fallback is **not** present.

### Added

- **Coverage** (`@vitest/coverage-v8`, `npm run test:coverage`) with 70% thresholds on the
  logic layer (utils/store/hooks/nav/data). Current: statements/lines **84.5%**, branches
  **71.5%**, functions **72%**. Wired into CI.
- **CI upgraded** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, replaces `security.yml`): now runs **lint** +
  **typecheck** + **tests with coverage** + **build** + **prod-dependency audit** on every push/PR.

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — dark-mode color-contrast failure (WCAG 1.4.3)

- Dark-theme `--text-muted` (#7E90B6) on `--surface-2` was **4.26:1**, below the 4.5:1 AA
  threshold for normal text. Lightened to **#8496BA** (4.58:1 on surface-2, 5.47:1 on paper) —
  a barely-perceptible change. Updated both `tokens.css` and the `sensei-theme.js` mirror (parity).

### Added

- **Deterministic color-contrast audit** (`tests/contrast.test.ts`) computing WCAG contrast
  ratios from the design tokens for both themes — the one a11y rule axe/jsdom can't evaluate
  without layout. Covers body/label pairs (≥4.5:1) and large/UI pairs (≥3:1). 92 tests green.
  (The audit initially had a vacuous dark-theme parse — `color-scheme:dark` sits at the block
  start, not the end — which masked this very failure; fixed to parse the full block.)

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — accessibility remediation across the app (found by expanded axe audit)

Expanding the axe suite from 7 screens to **all 26 routes + interactive overlays** surfaced 58
real WCAG violations the earlier assertion-based review missed. All fixed, behavior/visuals preserved:

- **`nested-interactive` (WCAG 4.1.2, serious)** — clickable rows containing action buttons
  (`.pat-row` on patients, `.notif-row` on notifications) restructured to the sibling-button
  pattern: the container is non-interactive, the primary click area is a reset-styled
  `<button>` that is a *sibling* of the action buttons. Full mouse + keyboard preserved;
  `stopPropagation` on the action buttons still works.
- **`aria-toggle-field-name` (12×)** — the avatar-color swatches (`role="radio"`) had no
  accessible name; added descriptive Hebrew `aria-label`s.
- **`heading-order`** — cards/sections jumping `h1 → h3` (resources, upload) corrected to
  `h2` (tag/level only; inline font styling unchanged).
- **`label`** — the upload date input gained an `aria-label` from its visible label.

### Tests

- Accessibility suite now covers **all 26 routes + auth + command palette + create dialog**
  (`tests/a11y.test.tsx`). Full suite: **88 tests green, stable.**

## [1.0.3] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — real accessibility bug (found by automated axe audit)

- **`nested-interactive` (WCAG 4.1.2, serious)** on the dashboard's today's-schedule rows: the
  store's a11y auto-promotion wrapped a clickable row that contains an inner upload button in
  `role="button"`, nesting two interactive controls. The promotion now skips containers that
  hold (or sit inside) another interactive element. Row mouse-click behavior is preserved and
  the inner control stays keyboard-operable. (Previously claimed AA compliance was assertion-based;
  this was caught only once axe ran against real rendered content.)

### Added

- **Automated accessibility tests** (`tests/a11y.test.tsx`) — axe-core over 7 key screens
  (auth, dashboard, patients, settings, upload, tasks, notifications), 0 structural violations,
  wired into the suite. **66 tests green, stable across repeated full-suite runs.**

## [1.0.2] — 2026-07-04

### Changed — deduplication & canonicalization (behavior-preserving)

- **Single source of truth for shared logic + data.** Consolidated previously-duplicated
  per-file copies into canonical modules — net **−265 LOC**:
  - `src/utils/search.ts` — `normHe`, `scoreP` (unified `(p, q, tagsMap)` signature), `hlParts`
    (were duplicated across command palette, app-bar search, patients list, search page).
  - `src/utils/format.ts` — `relTime` (was in app bar + settings sync tab).
  - `src/utils/dedup.ts` — `buildDupClusters` (was in dedup page + merge dialog).
  - `src/data/catalogs.ts` — `RES` (with the `meta` superset that search previously dropped),
    `DOCS`, `NOTIFS` (removes a latent search↔page divergence bug).
  - `src/data/sessions.ts` — shared session seed (`SESSION_DATES`, `SESSION_TOPICS`,
    `sessionSummaries`, `sessionRisk`); the 5 per-screen session builders now derive from it
    while keeping their distinct projections.
- Removed dead code surfaced by the cleanup (unused `hg` imports) and fixed a `useEffect`
  ref-cleanup warning in the store.

### Added

- **ESLint** (flat config, `typescript-eslint` + `react-hooks`) + `npm run lint`
  (`--max-warnings=0`, passing). Focuses on real-bug rules; `any`/inline-styles allowed (ported debt).
- **CSP + security headers** for deployment: `vercel.json` and `public/_headers` (Netlify) —
  `script-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (React inline styles), `connect-src 'self'`,
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`, HSTS, nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy. Verified
  compatible with the built output (no inline scripts).

### Tests

- Added `tests/searchUtils.test.ts` (normHe/scoreP/hlParts/relTime). Suite: 59 green.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed — production-readiness pass

- **Added a page-level error boundary** (`src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) wrapping the
  route render in `App.tsx`. A render error in one screen now shows a recoverable Hebrew alert
  card instead of white-screening the whole app; it self-clears on navigation. Previously any
  page-render throw would crash the entire app.
- **Fixed horizontal overflow on mobile** (`src/styles/global.css`): the off-canvas nav drawer
  (`position:fixed; translateX(105%)`) created ~80px of phantom horizontal scroll in RTL.
  `html, body { overflow-x: hidden }` removes it; verified the sticky app bar, vertical scroll,
  and drawer open/close are unaffected across mobile/tablet/desktop.
- **Added `@types/node`** + `tsconfig` `types: ["node", …]` so `tsc` (and `npm run build`) pass
  with the Node-based security tests present.

### Tests

- Added `tests/errorBoundary.test.tsx` (3 tests: catches a throw, recovers on resetKey change,
  passes children through). Added 2 network/tabnabbing static guards to `tests/security.test.ts`.
  Suite: 50 tests green.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added — initial production React port of prototype spec v2.2.0

- Vite + React 18 + TypeScript scaffold, RTL Hebrew (`<html lang="he" dir="rtl">`), port 3110.
- Canonical token CSS (58 tokens × light/dark) + base styles verbatim from the spec.
- Global store porting the prototype logic: state patches, debounced localStorage session
  persistence, theme (light/dark/system) + accessibility appliers, global keyboard
  shortcuts (Escape cascade, ⌘K, `?`, `/`, `N`, `G`), online/offline awareness.
- `navConfig()` single source of truth (sidebar + ⌘K palette + global search) per the
  v2.2.0 navigation contract; added the missing `documents` entry to `ROUTE_TITLES`.
- All 26 content routes ported as lazy-loaded pages + 5 auth states.
- App shell: sidebar (off-canvas drawer on mobile), appbar with global search, sync menu,
  notifications popover, theme toggle, upload CTA; overlays: keyboard-shortcuts dialog,
  command palette, AI assistant, action dialogs (create/edit/delete/merge/wipe/goal/
  schedule), snackbar.
- Shared `Pager` component (port of `Pager.dc.html`) used by patients/sessions/documents.
- Gendered-Hebrew microcopy layer (`hebrew-grammar.js`, window.HG) bundled and typed.
- Vitest suite: utils (100%), navConfig contract, route smoke renders for all 26 routes
  + auth view.
